<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps"><b>My Lords,</b></span></p>

<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Sir</span> <i>Robert Cotton,</i> that most Learned Treasurer of Antiquity, having by
perusal of my General History, and others, found that I had likewise
undergone divers other as hard hazards in the other Parts of the World,
requested me to fix the whole Course of my Passages in a Book by it self,
whose noble Desire I could not but in part satisfie; the rather, because
they have acted my fatal Tragedies upon the Stage, and racked my Relations
at their Pleasure. To prevent therefore all future Misprisions, I have
compiled this true Discourse. Envy hath taxed me to have writ too much,
and done too little; but that such should know, how little I esteem them,
I have writ this, more for the satisfaction of my Friends, and all generous
and well disposed Readers. To speak only of my self were intolerable
Ingratitude; because, having had so many Co-Partners with me; I cannot
make a Monument for my self, and leave them unburied in the Fields, whose
Lives begot me the Title of a Soldier; for as they were Companions with me
in my Dangers, so shall they be partakers with me in this Tomb.</p>

<p>For my <i>Sea Grammar</i> (caused to be Printed by my worthy Friend, Sir <i>Samuel
Saltenstall</i>) hath found such good Entertainment abroad, that I have been
importuned by many noble Persons, to let this also pass the Press. Many of
the most eminent Warriours, and others, what their Swords did, their Pens
writ: Though I be never so much their inferiour, yet I hold it no great
Errour, to follow good Examples; nor repine at them will do the like.</p>

<p>And now, <i>My most Honourable good Lords,</i> I know not to whom I may better
Present it, than to your Lordships, whose Friendships, as I conceive, are
as much to each others, as my Duty is to you all; and because you are
acquainted both with my Endeavours, and Writings, I doubt not, but your
Honours will as well accept of this, as of the rest, and Patronize it
under the shadow of your most noble Virtues, which I am ever bound in all
Duty to Reverence, and under which I hope to have shelter, against all
Storms that dare threaten,</p>

<p class="chap"> <i>His Birth; Apprenticeship; Going into</i> France; <i>His beginning with Ten
  Shillings and three Pence; His Service in the</i> Netherlands; <i>His bad
  Passage into</i> Scotland; <i>His return to</i> Willoughby, <i>and how he lived in
  the Woods.</i></p>


<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps">He was</span> born in <i>Willoughby</i> in <i>Lincoln-shire,</i> and a Scholar in the two
Free-Schools of <i>Alford</i> and <i>Louth.</i> His Father antiently descended from
the ancient <i>Smiths</i> of <i>Crudley</i> in <i>Lancashire;</i> his Mother from the
<i>Rickards</i> at Great <i>Heck,</i> in <i>York-shire.</i> His Parents dying when he was
about Thirteen Years of Age, left him a competent Means, which he not
being capable to manage, little regarded; his Mind being even then set
upon brave Adventures, sold his Satchel, Books, and all he had, intending
secretly to get to Sea, but that his Fathers Death stay'd him. But now the
Guardians of his Estate more regarding it than him, he had liberty enough,
though no Means, to get beyond the Sea. About the Age of Fifteen Years, he
was bound an Apprentice to Mr. <i>Thomas Sendalt</i> of <i>Linne,</i> the greatest
Merchant of all those Parts; but because he would not presently send him
to Sea, he never saw his Master in Eight Years after. At last he found
Means to attend Mr. <i>Peregrine Berty</i> into <i>France</i>, second Son to the
Right Honourable <i>Peregrine</i>, that generous Lord <i>Willoughby,</i> and famous
Soldier; where coming to his Brother <i>Robert,</i> then at <i>Orleans,</i> now Earl
of <i>Lindsey</i>, and Lord Great Chamberlain of <i>England;</i> being then but
little Youths under Tutorage: His Service being needless, within a Month
or six Weeks they sent him back again to his Friends; who when he came
from <i>London</i>, they liberally gave him (but out of his own Estate) Ten
Shillings to be rid of him; such oft is the share of Fatherless Children:
But those two Honourable Brethren gave him sufficient to return for
<i>England.</i> But it was the least thought of his Determination, for now
being freely at liberty in <i>Paris</i>, growing acquainted with one Mr. <i>David
Hume,</i> who making some use of his Purse, gave him Letters to his Friends
in <i>Scotland</i> to prefer him to King <i>James.</i> Arriving at <i>Roan,</i> he better
bethinks himself, seeing his Money near spent, down the River he went to
<i>Haver de grace,</i> where he first began to learn the Life of a Soldier:
Peace being concluded in <i>France,</i> he went with Captain <i>Joseph Duxbury</i>
into the Low-Countries, under whose Colours, having served three or four
Years, he took his Journey for <i>Scotland,</i> to deliver his Letters. At
<i>Ancusan</i> he imbark'd himself for <i>Lethe,</i> but as much danger, as
Shipwreck and Sickness could endure, he had at the Holy Isle in
<i>Northumberland</i> near Berwick, ( being recovered ) into <i>Scotland</i> he went
to deliver his Letters. After much kind usage among those honest <i>Scots</i> at
<i>Ripweth</i> and <i>Broxmoth,</i> but neither Money nor Means to make him a
Courtier, he returned to <i>Willoughby</i> in <i>Lincoln-shire;</i> where within a
short time, being glutted with too much Company, wherein he took small
delight, he retired himself into a little Woody Pasture, a good way from
any Town, invironed with many hundred Acres of other Woods: Here, by a fair
Brook he built a Pavillion of Boughs, where only in his Cloths he lay. His
Study was <i>Machiavil's</i> Art of War, and <i>Marcus Aurelius;</i> his exercise a
good Horse, with his Lance and Ring; his Food was thought to be more of
Venison than any thing else; what he wanted his Man brought him. The
Country wondering at such an Hermite, his Friends perswaded one Seignior
<i>Theodora Polaloga,</i> Rider to <i>Henry</i> Earl of <i>Lincoln,</i> an excellent Horse
Man, and a Noble <i>Italian</i> Gentleman, to insinuate into his Woodish
Acquaintance, whose Languages and good Discourse, and Exercise of Riding
drew him to stay with him at <i>Tattersall.</i> Long these Pleasures could not
content him, but he returned again to the Low Countries.</p>

<p class="cchap"> <i>The notable Villany of four</i> French <i>Gallants, and his revenge;</i> Smith<br>
  <i>thrown over-board; Captain</i> La Roche <i>of Saint</i> Malo <i>relieves him.</i></p>


<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Thus</span> when <i>France</i> and <i>Netherlands</i> had taught him to Ride a Horse, and
use his Arms, with such Rudiments of War, as his tender Years in those
Martial Schools could attain unto; he was desirous to see more of the
World, and try his Fortune against the <i>Turks,</i> both repenting and
lamenting to have seen so many <i>Christians</i> slaughter one another. {MN}
Opportunity calling him; into the Company of four <i>French</i> Gallants well
attended, faining to him the one to be a great Lord, the rest his
Gentlemen, and that they were all devoted that way; over-perswaded him to
go with them into <i>France,</i> to the Dutchess of <i>Merceur,</i> from whom they
should not only have Means, but also Letters of Favour to her Noble Duke,
then General for the Emperour <i>Rolduphus</i> in <i>Hungary;</i> which he did, with
such ill Weather as Winter affordeth, in the dark Night they arrived in
the broad shallow In-let of St. <i>Valleries sur Soame</i> in <i>Picardie;</i> His
<i>French</i> Lord knowing he had good Apparel, and better furnished with Money
than themselves, so Plotted with the Master of the Ship, to set his and
their own Trunks ashore, leaving <i>Smith</i> aboard till the Boat could return,
which was the next day after, towards Evening: The reason he alledged,
was, the Sea went so high he could come no sooner, and that his Lord was
gone to <i>Amiens,</i> where they would stay his coming; which treacherous
Villany, when divers other Soldiers, and Passengers understood, they had
like to have slain the Master, and had they known how, would have run away
with the Ship.</p>

<p class="quote"> {MN} <i>A notable Villany of four</i> French <i>Gallants.</i></p>


<p>Coming on shoar, he had but one <i>Cavvalue,</i> {MN-1} was forced to sell his
Cloak to pay for his Passage. One of the Soldiers, called <i>Curzianvere,</i>
compassionating his Injury, assured him, this great Lord <i>Depreau</i> was
only the Son of a Lawyer of <i>Mortaigne</i> in base <i>Britany,</i> and his
Attendants <i>Cursell, La Nelie,</i> and <i>Monserrat,</i> three young Citizens, as
arrant Cheats as himself; but if he would accompany him, he would bring
him to their Friends, but in the <i>interim</i> supplied his wants: Thus
Travelling by <i>Deepe, Cadebeck, Humphla, Pount-demer</i> in <i>Normandy,</i>
they came to <i>Caen</i> in base <i>Normandy;</i> where both this Noble
<i>Curzianvere,</i> and the great Prior of the great Abbey of St. <i>Steven</i>
(where is the ruinous Tomb of <i>William</i> the Conqueror) and many other of
his Friends kindly welcomed him, and brought him to <i>Montaigne,</i> where he
found <i>Depreau</i> and the rest, but to small purpose; for Mr. <i>Curzianvere</i>
was a banished Man, and durst not be seen but to his Friends: yet the
bruit of their Cozenage occasioned the Lady <i>Collumber,</i> the Baron
<i>Larshan,</i> the Lord <i>Shasghe,</i> and divers other honourable Persons, to
supply his wants, and with them to recreate him-self so long as he would;
But such pleasant pleasures suited little with his poor Estate, and his
restless Spirit, that could never find content, to receive such Noble
Favours, as he could neither deserve nor requite: But wandering from Port
to Port to find some Man of War, spent that he had, and in a Forest, near
dead with grief and cold, a rich Farmer found him by a fair Fountain,
under a Tree: This kind Peasant relieved him again to his content, to
follow his intent. {MN-2} Not long after, as he passed thorow a great Grove
of Trees, between <i>Pounterson</i> and <i>Dina</i> in <i>Britany,</i> it was his chance
to meet <i>Cursell,</i> more miserable than himself: His piercing Injuries had
so small patience, as without any word they both drew, and in a short time
<i>Cursell</i> fell to the Ground, where, from an old ruinated Tower, the
Inhabitants seeing them, were satisfied, when they heard <i>Cursell</i> confess
what had formerly passed; and that how, in the dividing that they had
stolen from him, they fell by the Ears amongst themselves, that were
Actors in it; but for his part, he excused himself to be innocent as well
of the one, as of the other. In regard of his hurt, <i>Smith</i> was glad to be
so rid of him, directing his course to an honourable Lord, the Earl of
<i>Ployer,</i> {MN-3} who during the War in <i>France,</i> with his two Brethren,
Viscount <i>Poomory,</i> and Baron <i>d'Mercy,</i> who had been brought up in
<i>England;</i> by him he was better refurnished than ever. When they had shewed
him Saint <i>Malo</i> Mount, Saint <i>Michael, Lambal, Simbreack, Lanion,</i> and
their own fair Castle of <i>Tuncadeck, Gingan,</i> and divers other places in
<i>Britany</i> (and their British <i>Cornwaile</i>) taking his leave, he took his
way to <i>Raynes,</i> the <i>Britains</i> chief City, and so to <i>Nants, Poyters,
Rochel,</i> and <i>Bourdeaux.</i> The rumour of the strength of <i>Bayon</i> in
<i>Biskay,</i> caused him to see it; and from thence took his way from <i>Leskar</i>
in <i>Bicarne,</i> and <i>Paw,</i> in the Kingdom of <i>Navarre</i> to <i>Tolouza</i> in
<i>Gascoigne, Bezers,</i> and <i>Carcassone, Narbone, Montpelier, Nimes</i> in
<i>Languedeck,</i> and thorow the Country of <i>Avignion,</i> by <i>Aries</i> to
<i>Marseilles</i> in <i>Provence,</i> there imbarking himself for <i>Italy;</i> the Ship
was inforced to <i>Tolonne,</i> and putting again to Sea, ill Weather so grew
upon them, that they Anchored close aboard the Shoar, under the little Isle
of St. <i>Mary,</i> against <i>Nice</i> in <i>Savoy.</i> Here the inhuman Provincials, with a
Rabble of Pilgrims of divers Nations going to <i>Rome,</i> hourly cursing him,
not only for a <i>Hugonot</i> but his Nation they swore were all Pirats, and so
vilely railed on his dread Soveraign Queen <i>Elizabeth,</i> and that they never
should have fair Weather so long as he was aboard them; their Disputations
grew to that Passion, that they threw him over board, yet God brought him
to that little Isle, where was no Inhabitants, but a few Kine and Goats.
The next Morning, he espied two Ships more riding by them, put in by the
Storm, that fetched him aboard, well refreshed him, and so kindly used
him, that he was well contented to try the rest of his Fortune with them.
{MN-5} After he had related unto them his former Discourse, what for
pity, and the love of the Honourable Earl of <i>Ployer,</i> this Noble
<i>Britain</i> his Neighbour, Captain <i>la Roche</i> of Saint <i>Malo,</i> regarded and
entertained him for his well respected Friend. With the next fair Wind,
they Sailed along by the Coast of <i>Corsica</i> and <i>Sardinia,</i> and crossing
the Gulf of <i>Tunis,</i> passed by Cape <i>Bona</i> to the Isle of <i>Lempadosa,</i>
leaving the Coast of <i>Barbary</i> till they came at <i>Cape Rasata,</i> and so
along the <i>African</i> Shoar, for <i>Alexandria</i> in <i>&AElig;gypt.</i> There delivering
their Fraught, they went to <i>Seandaroone,</i> rather to view what Ships were
in the Road, than any thing else: keeping their Course by <i>Cypres,</i> and the
Coast of <i>Asia,</i> Sailing by <i>Rhodes</i>, the <i>Archipelagus, Candia,</i> and the
Coast of <i>Grecia,</i> and the Isle of <i>Zefalonia.</i> They lay to and again a
few days, betwixt the Isle of <i>Corsue,</i> and the Cape of <i>Orranto,</i> in the
Kingdom of <i>Naples,</i> in the Entrance of the <i>Adriatick</i> Sea.</p>

<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Betwixt</span> the two <i>Capes</i>, they met with an <i>Argosie</i> of <i>Venice</i>; it seemed
the Captain desired to speak with them, whose untoward answer was such, as
slew them a Man; {MN} whereupon the <i>Britain</i> presently gave them the
Broad-side, then his Stern, and his other Broad-side also, and continued
the Chase, with his chase Pieces, till he gave them so many Broad-sides
one after another, that the <i>Argosies</i> Sails and Tackling was so torn, she
stood to her defence, and made shot for shot; twice in one hour and a half
the <i>Britain</i> boarded her, yet they cleared themselves, but clapping her
aboard again, the <i>Argosie</i> fired him, which with much danger to them
both was presently quenched. This rather augmented the <i>Britain's</i> rage,
than abated his courage; for having reaccommodated himself again, shot
her so oft between Wind and Water, she was ready to sink, then they

there was six or seven Galleys at <i>Messina,</i> he departed thence for

the Kingdom of <i>Sicilia</i>, by <i>Sardinia</i> and <i>Corsica</i>, till he came to the
Road of <i>Antibo</i> in <i>Peamon,</i> where he set <i>Smith</i> on shoar with five

say, are those our Savior Christ went up to <i>Pontius Pilate,</i> where blood,
falling from his Head, being pricked with his Crown of Thorns, the drops
are marked with Nails of Steel, upon them none dare go but in that manner,
saying so many <i>Ave-Maries</i> and <i>Pater-Nosters,</i> as is their Devotion, and

Silver Lamp, which burneth continually; yet they say, the Oil neither
increaseth nor diminisheth. A little distant is the ancient Church of
Saint <i>John de Lateran,</i> where he saw him say Mass, which commonly he doth
upon some Friday once a Month. Having saluted Father <i>Parsons,</i> that
famous <i>English</i> Jesuit, and satisfied himself with the Rarities of

embarked himself, to satisfie his Eye with the fair City of <i>Naples,</i> and

slain; many of the rest drowned, but all fled. The other part of the Army
was so busied to resist the false fires, that <i>Kisel</i> before the Morning
put two thousand good Soldiers in the Town, and with small loss was
retired; the Garrison was well relieved with what they found in the

<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps">A General</span> rumour of a general Peace, now spred it self over all the face
of those tormented Countries: but the <i>Turk</i> intended no such matter, but
levied Soldiers from all Parts he could. The Emperour also, by the
assistance of the <i>Christian</i> Princes, provided three Armies, the one led
by the Arch-duke <i>Matthias,</i> the Emperour's Brother, and his Lieutenant
Duke <i>Merceur</i> to defend Low <i>Hungary;</i> the second, by <i>Ferdinando</i> the
Arch-duke of <i>Styria,</i> and the Duke of <i>Mantua</i> his Lieutenant to regain

<p>Duke <i>Merceur</i> with an Army or Thirty thousand, whereof near Ten thousand
were <i>French,</i> besieged <i>Stoll-weissenburg,</i> otherwise called <i>Alba

impregnable. At his first coming, The <i>Turks</i> sallied upon the <i>German</i>
Quarter, slew near five hundred, and returned before they were thought on.
The next Night in like manner, they did near as much to the <i>Bemers,</i> and
<i>Hungarians;</i> of which, Fortune still presuming, thinking to have found
the <i>French</i> quarter as careless, Eight or Nine hundred of them were cut
in pieces and taken Prisoners. In this Encounter Monsieur <i>Grandvile,</i>
a brave <i>French</i> Colonel, received seven or eight cruel Wounds, yet
followed the Enemy to the Ports; he came off alive, but within three or
four days died.</p>

<p>Earl <i>Moldritch,</i> by the Information of of three or four <i>Christians,</i>
(escaped out of the Town) upon every Alarum, where there was greatest
Assemblies and throng of People, {MN} caused Captain <i>Smith</i> to put in
practice his fiery Dragons, he had demonstrated unto him, and the Earl
<i>Von Sulch</i> at <i>Comora</i> which he thus performed: Having prepared forty or
fifty round-bellied Earthen Pots, and filled them with hand Gun powder,
then covered them with Pitch, mingled with Brimstone and Turpentine; and
quartering as many Musket-bullets, that hung together but only at the
Center of the division, stuck them round in the mixture about the Pots,
and covered them again with the same mixture, over that a strong
Searcloth, then over all, a good thickness of Towze-match, well tempered
with Oyl of Lin-seed, Camphire, and Powder of Brimstone, these he fitly
placed in Slings, graduated so near as they could to the places of these
Assemblies. At mid-night upon the Alarum, it was a fearful sight to see
the short flaming course of their flight in the Air, but presently after
their fall, the lamentable noise of the miserable slaughtered <i>Turks</i> was
most wonderful to hear: Besides, they had fired that Suburb at the Port of
<i>Buda</i> in two or three places, which so troubled the <i>Turks</i> to quench,
that had there been any means to have assaulted them, they could hardly
have resisted the fire, and their Enemies. The Earl <i>Rosworme,</i> contrary
to the opinion of all Men, would needs undertake to find means to surprize
the Segeth and Suburb of the City, strongly defended by a muddy Lake,
which was thought unpassable.</p>

<p>The Duke having planted his Ordnance, battered the other side, {MN-1}
whilst <i>Rosworme</i> in the dark Night, with every Man a bundle of Sedge and
Bavins still thrown before them, so laded up the Lake, as they surprised
that unregarded Suburb before they were discovered: Upon which unexpected
Alarum, the <i>Turks</i> fled into the City, and the other Suburb not knowing
the matter, got into the City also, leaving their Suburb for the Duke,
who, with no great resistance, took it, with many Pieces of Ordnance; the
City, being of no such strength as the Suburbs, with their own Ordnance
was so battered, that it was taken by force, with such a merciless
Execution, as was most pitiful to behold. {MN-2} The <i>Bashaw</i>
notwithstanding, drew together a Party of Five hundred before his own
Palace, where he intended to die; but seeing most of his Men slain before
him, by the valiant Captain, Earl <i>Meldritch,</i> who took him Prisoner with
his own hands; and with the hazard of himself saved him from the fury of
other Troops, that did pull down his Palace, and would have rent him in
pieces, had he not been thus preserved. The Duke thought his Victory much
honoured with such a Prisoner; took order, he should be used like a
Prince, and with all expedition gave charge presently to repair the
Breaches, and the Ruins of this famous City, that had been in the
possession of the <i>Turks</i> near threescore years.</p>

<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps"><i>Mahomet</i></span> the Great <i>Turk</i>, during the Siege, had raised an Army of Sixty
thousand Men to have relieved it; but hearing it was lost, he sent <i>Assan
Bashaw,</i> General of his Army, the <i>Bashaw</i> of <i>Buda, Bashaw Amaroz,</i> to
see if it were possible to regain it; The Duke understanding there could
be no great experience in such a new levied Army as <i>Assan</i> had, having
put a strong Garrison into it, and with the brave Colonel <i>Rosworme,
Culnits, Meldritch,</i> the <i>Rhine Grave, Vahan,</i> and many others, with
Twenty thousand good Soldiers, set forward to meet the <i>Turk,</i> in the
Plains of <i>Girk.</i> {MN-1} Those two Armies encountred as they marched,
where began a hot and bloody Skirmish betwixt them, Regiment against
Regiment, as they came in order, till the night parted them: Here Earl
<i>Meldritch</i> was so invironed among those half circular Regiments of
<i>Turks,</i> they supposed him their Prisoner, and his Regiment lost; but his
two most couragious Friends, <i>Vahan</i> and <i>Culnits,</i> made such a Passage
amongst them, that it was a terror to see how Horse and Man lay sprawling
and tumbling, some one way, some another on the Ground. The Earl there at
that time made his valour shine more bright than his Armour, which seemed
then painted with <i>Turkish</i> Blood; he slew the brave <i>Zanzack Bugola,</i> and
made his Passage to his Friends, but near half his Regiment was slain.
Captain <i>Smith</i> had his Horse slain under him, and himself sore wounded;
but he was not long unmounted, for there was choice enough of Horses, that
wanted Masters. The <i>Turk,</i> thinking the Victory sure against the Duke,
whose Army, by the Siege and the Garrison, he had left behind him, was
much weakened, would not be content with one, but he would have all; and
lest the Duke should return to <i>Alba Regalis,</i> he sent that Night Twenty
thousand to besiege the City, assuring them, he would keep the Duke or any
other from relieving them. Two or three days they lay each by other,
entrenching themselves; the <i>Turks</i> daring the Duke daily to a sett
Battle, {MN-2} who at length drew out his Army, led by the <i>Rhine-Grave,
Culnits,</i> and <i>Meldritch</i> who upon their first Encounter, charged with
that resolute and valiant courage, as disordered not only the foremost
Squadrons of the <i>Turks,</i> but enforced all the whole Army to retire to the
Camp, with the loss of five or six thousand, with the <i>Bashaw</i> of <i>Buda,</i>
and four or five <i>Zanzacks,</i> with divers other great Commanders, Two
hundred Prisoners, and nine pieces of Ordnance. At that instant appeared,
as it were, another Army coming out of a Valley over a plain Hill, that
caused the Duke at that time to be contented, and to retire to his
Trenches; which gave time to <i>Assan,</i> to reorder his disordered Squadrons:
Here they lay nine or ten days, and more Supplies repaired to them,
expecting to try the event in a sett Battle; but the Soldiers on both
Parties, by reason of their great Wants, and approach of Winter, grew so
discontented, that they were ready of themselves to break up the Leager;
the <i>Bashaw</i> retiring himself to <i>Buda,</i> had some of the Rear Troops cut
off. <i>Amaroz Bashaw</i> hearing of this, found such bad welcome at <i>Alba
Regalis,</i> and the Town so strongly repaired with so brave a Garrison,
raised his Siege, and retired to <i>Zigetum.</i></p>

The Duke understanding, that the Archduke <i>Ferdinando,</i> had so resolutely

retreat to <i>Buda,</i> being void of hope of any relief, doubted not, but it

the Nobility with as much honour received him, as if he had conquered all

thousands kept as curiously as a precious relique. To requite this honour,
preparing himself to return into <i>France,</i> to raise new Forces against the

whithersoever. Now this Noble Earl was a <i>Transilvanian</i> born, and his

in three Divisions, though the Prince had the Hearts both of Country and

among those Rocky Mountains, where were some <i>Turks,</i> some <i>Tartars,</i> but
most <i>Bandittoes, Rennegadoes,</i> and such like, which sometimes he forced
into the Plains of <i>Regall</i> where is a City, not only of Men and
Fortifications, Strong of it self, but so environed with Mountains, that
made the Passages so difficult, that in all these Wars, no attempt had
been made upon it to any purpose: Having satisfied himself with the
Situation, and the most convenient Passages to bring his Army into it: The
Earth no sooner put on her green Habit, than the Earl overspread her with
his armed Troops. To possess himself first of the most convenient Passage,
which was a narrow Valley betwixt two high Mountains; he sent Colonel
<i>Veltus</i> with his Regiment; dispersed in Companies to lie in <i>Ambuscado,</i>
as he had directed them, and in the Morning to drive all the Cattel they
could find before a Fort in that Passage, whom he supposed would sally,
seeing but some small Party to recover their prey; which took such good
success, that the Garrison was cut off by the <i>Ambuscado,</i> and <i>Veltus</i>
seized on the Skonces, which were abandoned. <i>Meldritch</i> glad of so
fortunate a beginning, it was six days ere he could with six thousand
Pioneers make passage for his Ordnance: The <i>Turks</i> having such warning,
strengthened the Town so with Men and Provision, that they made a scorn of
so small a number as <i>Meldritch</i> brought with him before the City, which was
but eight thousand. Before they had pitched their Tents, the <i>Turks</i>
sallied in such abundance, as for an hour, they had rather a bloody Battel
than a Skirmish, but with the loss of near Fifteen hundred on both sides.
The Turks were chased till the Cities Ordnance caused the Earl to retire.
{M-2} The next day <i>Zachel Moyses,</i> General of the Army, pitched also his
Tents with nine thousand Foot and Horse, and six and twenty Pieces of
Ordnance; but in regard of the Situation of this strong Fortress, they did
neither fear them nor hurt them, being upon the point of a fair
Promontory, environed on the one side within half a Mile with an un-useful
Mountain, and on the other side with a fair Plain, where the <i>Christians</i>
encamped, but so commanded by their Ordnance, they spent near a Month in
entrenching themselves, and raising their Mounts to plant their Batteries;
which slow proceedings the <i>Turks</i> oft derided, that their Ordnance were
at pawn, and how they grew fat for want of Exercise, and fearing lest they
should depart ere they could assault their City, sent this Challenge to
any Captain in the Army.</p>

Company, who durst Combate with him for his Head: The matter being
discussed, it was accepted, but so many Questions grew for the
undertaking, it was decided by Lots, which fell upon Captain <i>Smith,</i>
before spoken of.</p>

<p>{MN} Truce being made for that time, the Rampires all beset with fair
Dames, and Men in Arms, the <i>Christians</i> in <i>Battalia; Turbashaw</i> with a
noise of Haut-boys entred the Field well mounted and armed; on his
shoulders were fixed a pair of great Wings, compacted of Eagles Feathers,
within a ridge of Silver, richly garnished with Gold and precious Stones,
a <i>Janizary</i> before him, bearing his Lance, on each side another leading
his Horse; where long he stayed not, ere <i>Smith</i> with a noise of Trumpets,
only a Page bearing his Lance, passing by him with a courteous Salute,
took his Ground with such good success, that at the sound of the charge,
he passed the <i>Turk</i> thorow the sight of his Beaver, Face, Head and all,
that he fell dead to the Ground, where alighting and unbracing his Helmet,
cut off his Head, and the <i>Turks</i> took his Body; and so returned without
any hurt at all. The Head he presented to the Lord <i>Moyses,</i> the General,
who kindly accepted it, and with joy to the whole Army he was generally
welcomed.</p>

<p class="quote"> {MN} <i>Three single combates.</i></p>


<p>The Death of this Captain so swelled in the Heart of one <i>Grualgo,</i> his
vowed Friend, as rather inraged with madness than choler, he directed a
particular challenge to the Conqueror, to regain his Friends Head, or Idle
his own, with his Horse and Armour for advantage, which according to his
desire, was the next day undertaken: as before upon the sound of the
Trumpets, their Lances flew in pieces upon a clear Passage, but the
<i>Turk,</i> was near unhorsed. Their Pistols was the next, which marked
<i>Smith</i> upon the Placard; but the next shot the <i>Turk,</i> was so Wounded in
the left Arm, that being not able to rule his Horse, and defend himself,
he was thrown to the ground, and so bruised with the fall, that he lost
his Head, as his Friend before him, with his Horse and Armour; but his
Body, and his rich Apparel were sent back to the Town.</p>

<p>Every day the <i>Turks</i> made some Sallies, but few Skirmishes would they
endure to any purpose. Our Works and Approaches being not yet advanced to
that heighth and effect, which was of necessity to be performed; to delude
time, <i>Smith</i> with so many incontradictible perswading Reasons, obtained
leave, that the Ladies might know he was not so much enamoured of their
Servants Heads; but if any <i>Turk,</i> of their rank would come to the place
of Combate to redeem them, should have his also upon the like conditions,
if he could win it.</p>

<p>The challenge presently was accepted by <i>Bonny Mulgro.</i> The next day, both
the Champions entring the Field as before, each discharging their Pistol,
having no Lances, but such martial Weapons as the Defendant appointed, no
hurt was done; their Battle-Axes was the next, whose piercing Bills made
sometime the one, sometime the other to have scarce sense to keep their
Saddles, specially the <i>Christian</i> received such a blow, that he lost his
Battle axe, and failed not much to have fallen after it, whereat the
supposed conquering <i>Turk,</i> had a great shout from the Rampires. The
<i>Turk,</i> prosecuted his advantage to the uttermost of his power; yet the
other, what by the readiness of his Horse, and his judgement and dexterity
in such a business, beyond all Mens expectation, by God's assistance, not
only avoided the <i>Turks</i> violence but having drawn his Faulchion, pierced
the <i>Turk,</i> so under the Culets, thorow back and body, that altho' he
alighted from his Horse, he stood not long ere he lost his Head, as the
rest had done.</p>

<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps">This good</span> success gave such great encouragement to the whole Army, that
with a Guard of six thousand, three spare Horses, before each a <i>Turks</i>
Head upon a Lance, he was conducted to the Generals Pavilion with his
Presents. Moyses received both him and them, with as much respect as the
occasion deserved, embracing him in his Arms, gave him a fair Horse,
richly furnished, a Scimitar and Belt worth Three hundred Ducats; and
<i>Meldritch</i> made him Sergeant Major of his Regiment. But now to the Siege,
having mounted six and twenty pieces of Ordnance, fifty or sixty Foot
above the Plain, made them so plainly tell his meaning, that within
fifteen days two Breaches were made, which the <i>Turks</i> as valiantly
defended as Men could; that day was made a darksome Night, but by the
light that proceeded from the murdering Muskets, and peace-making Canon,
whilst their slothful Governour lay in a Castle on the top of a high
Mountain, and like a Valiant Prince asketh what's the matter, when horror
and death flood amazed each at other, to see who should prevail to make
him victorious: {MN} <i>Moyses</i> commanding a general assault upon the
sloping front of the high Promontory, where the Barons of <i>Budendorfe</i> and
<i>Oberwin,</i> lost near half their Regiments, by Logs, Bags of Powder,
and such like, tumbling down the Hill, they were to mount ere they could
come to the breach; notwithstanding with an incredible courage, they
advanced to the push of the Pike with the Defendants, that with the like
courage repulsed, till the Earl <i>Meldritch, Becklefield</i> and <i>Zarvana,</i>
with their fresh Regiments seconded them with that fury, that the <i>Turks</i>
retired and fled into the Castle, from whence by a Flag of truce they
desired composition. The Earl remembring his Fathers Death, battered it
with all the Ordnance in the Town, and the next day took it: all he found
could bear Arms, he put to the Sword, and set their Heads upon Stakes
round about the Walls, in the same manner they had used the <i>Christians,</i>
when they took it. <i>Moyses</i> having repaired the Rampires, and thrown down
the Work in his Camp, he put in it a strong Garrison, though the pillage
he had gotten in the Town was much, having been for a long time an
impregnable den of Thieves; yet the loss of the Army so intermingled the
sowre with the sweet, as forced <i>Moyses</i> to seek a farther revenge, that
he sacked <i>Veratio, Solmos,</i> and <i>Kupronka,</i> and with two thousand
Prisoners, most Women and Children, came to <i>Esenberg,</i> not far from the
Princes Palace, where he there Encamped.</p>

<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps"><i>Busca</i></span> having all this time been raising new Forces, was commanded from
the Emperour again to invade <i>Transilvania,</i> which being one of the
fruitfullest and strongest Countries in those Parts, was now rather a
Desart, or the very Spectacle of Desolation; their Fruits and Fields
overgrown with Weeds, their Churches and battered Palaces, and best
Buildings, as for fear, hid with Moss and Ivy; being the very Bulwark and
Rampire of a great part of <i>Europe,</i> most fit by all <i>Christians</i> to have
been supplied and maintained, was thus brought to ruin by them, it most
concerned to support it. But alas, what is it, when the Power of Majesty
pampered in all delights of pleasant Vanity, neither knowing, nor
considering the labour of the Plough-man, the hazard of the Merchant, the
oppression of Statesmen, nor feeling the piercing Torments of broken
Limbs, and inveterate Wounds, the toilsome Marches, the bad Lodging, the
hungry Diet, and the extream misery that Soldiers endure to secure all
those Estates, and yet by the spight of malicious detraction, starves for
want of their Reward and Recompences, whilst the politique Courtier, that
commonly aims more at his own Honours and Ends, than his Countries good,
or his Princes Glory, Honour, or Security, as this worthy Prince too well
could testifie. But the Emperor being certified how weak and desperate
his Estate was, sent <i>Busca</i> again with a great Army, to try his fortune
once more in <i>Transilvania.</i> The Prince considering how his Country and
Subjects were consumed, the small means he had any longer to defend his
Estate, both against the cruelty of the <i>Turk,</i> and the power of the
Emperor, and the small care the <i>Polanders</i> had in Supplying him, as they
had promised, sent to <i>Busca</i> to have truce, till Messengers might be
sent to the Emperour for some better agreement, wherewith <i>Busca</i> was
contented. The Ambassadors so prevailed, that the Emperour re-assured
unto them the conditions he had promised the Prince at their confederacy
for the Lands in <i>Silesia,</i> with 60000 Ducats presently in hand, and
50000 Ducats yearly as a Pension. When this conclusion was known to
<i>Moyses,</i> his Lieutenant then in the Field with the Army, that would do
any thing, rather than come in subjection to the <i>Germans,</i> he encouraged
his Soldiers, and without any more ado, marched to encounter <i>Busca,</i> {MN}
whom he found much better provided than he expected; so that betwixt them,
in six or seven hours, more than five or six thousand, on both sides, lay
dead in the field. <i>Moyses</i> thus overthrown, fled to the <i>Turks</i> at
<i>Temesware,</i> and his Scattered Troops, some one way, some another.

<p>The Prince understanding of this so sudden and unexpected Accident, only
accompanied with an hundred of his Gentry and Nobility, went into the
Camp to <i>Busca,</i> to let him know how ignorant he was of his Lieutenants
error, that he had done it without his direction or knowledge, freely
offering to perform what was concluded by his Ambassadors with the
Emperor; {MN} and so causing all his Garrisons to come out of their strong
Holds, he delivered all to <i>Busca</i> for the Emperor, and so went to
<i>Prague,</i> where he was honourably received, and established in his
Possessions, as his Imperial Majesty had promised. <i>Busca</i> assembling all
the Nobility, took their Oaths of Allegiance and Fidelity, and thus their
Prince being gone <i>Transilvania</i> became again subject to the Emperor.</p>

caused the People to take Arms against him, so that he was forced to flie
into the Confines of <i>Moldavia;</i> and <i>Busca</i> in the behalf of the Emperor,
proclaimed the Lord <i>Rodol</i> in his stead. But <i>Jeremy</i> having assembled
an Army of forty thousand <i>Turks, Tartars,</i> and <i>Moldavians,</i> returned
into <i>Wallachia. Rodol</i> not yet able to raise such a power, fled into

subject to the Emperor, or at least such an Employment for the remainders

lying at <i>Argish,</i> drew his Army into his old Camp, in the Plains of

himself, till more power came to him from the <i>Crim-Tartar.</i> Many small
Parties that came to his Camp, <i>Rodol</i> cut off, and in the nights would
cause their Heads to be thrown up and down before the Trenches. Seven of

burning and spoiling all where he came, and returned again towards
<i>Rebrink</i> in the night, as if he had fled upon the general rumour of the
<i>Crim-Tartars</i> coming, which so inflamed the <i>Turks</i> of a happy Victory,
they urged <i>Jeremy</i> against his Will to follow them. <i>Rodol</i> seeing his
Plot fell out as he desired, so ordered the matter, that having regained
the Streights, he put his Army in order, that had been near two days
pursued with continual Skirmishes in his Rear, {MN-1} which now making
Head against the Enemy, that followed with their whole Army in the best
manner they could, was furiously charged with six thousand <i>Heydukes,
Wallachians,</i> and <i>Moldavians,</i> led by three Colonels, <i>Oversall,
Dubras</i>, and <i>Calab,</i> to entertain the time till the rest came up;
<i>Veltus</i> and <i>Nederspolt</i> with their Regiments, entertained them with the
like courage, till the Zanzacke <i>Hamesbeg,</i> with six thousand more, came
with a fresh charge, which <i>Meldritch</i> and <i>Budendorfe,</i> rather like
enraged Lions, than Men, so bravely encountred, as if in them only had
consisted the Victory; <i>Meldritch's</i> Horse being slain under him, the
<i>Turks</i> pressed what they could to have taken him Prisoner, but being
remounted, it was thought with his own hand he slew the valiant Zanzacke,
whereupon his Troops retiring, the two proud <i>Bashawes, Aladin,</i> and
<i>Zizimmus,</i> brought up the front of the body of their Battle. <i>Veltus,</i>
and <i>Nederspolt</i> having breathed, and joyning their Troops with
<i>Becklefield</i> and <i>Zarvana,</i> with such an incredible courage, charged the
left flank of <i>Zizimmus,</i> as put them all in disorder, where <i>Zizimmus</i>
the <i>Bashaw</i> was taken Prisoner, but died presently upon his Wounds.
<i>Jeremy</i> seeing now the main Battel of <i>Rodol</i> advance, being thus
constrained, like a Valiant Prince in his front of the Vangard, by his
example so bravely encouraged his Soldiers, that <i>Rodol</i> found no great
assurance of the Victory. Thus being joyned in this bloody Massacre, that
there was Scarce Ground to stand upon, but upon the dead Carcases, which
in less than an hour, were So mingled, as if each Regiment had singled
out other. The admired <i>Aladin</i> that day did leave behind him a glorious
name for his Valour, whose Death, many of his Enemies did lament after the
Victory, which at that instant fell to <i>Rodol.</i> It was reported, <i>Jeremy</i>
was also slain; but it Was not so, but fled with the remainder of his Army
to <i>Moldavia,</i> leaving five and twenty thousand dead in the Field, of both
Armies. {MN-2} And thus <i>Rodol</i> was seated again in his Soveraignty, and
<i>Wallachia</i> became subject  to the Emperour.</p>

<p>But long he rested not to settle his new Estate, but there came News,
that certain Regiments of stragling <i>Tartars,</i> were foraging those Parts
towards <i>Moldavia. Meldritch</i> with thirteen thousand Men was sent against
them, but when they heard it was the <i>Crim-Tartar,</i> and his two Sons,
with an Army of thirty thousand; and <i>Jeremy,</i> that had escaped with
fourteen or fifteen thousand, lay in ambush for them about <i>Langanaw,</i> he
retired towards <i>Rottenton,</i> a strong Garrison for <i>Rodol;</i> but they were
so invironed with these hellish numbers, they could make no great hast
for skirmishing with their Scouts, Foragers, and small Parties that still
encountred them. But one night amongst the rest, having made a passage
through a Wood, with an incredible expedition, cutting Trees thwart each
other to hinder their passage, in a thick Fogg, early in the Morning,
unexpectedly they met two thousand loaded with Pillage, and two or three
hundred Horse and Cattel; the most of them were slain and taken Prisoners,
who told them where <i>Jeremy</i> lay in the passage, expecting the
<i>Crim-Tartar</i> that was not far from him. <i>Meldritch</i> intending to make
his passage by force, was advised of a pretty Stratagem, by the English
<i>Smith,</i> which presently he thus accomplished; for having accommodated
two or three hundred Trunks with wild-fire, upon the Heads of Lances, and
charging the Enemy in the night, gave fire to the Trunks, which blazed
forth such Flames and Sparkles, that it so amazed not only their Horses,
but their Foot also; that by the means of this flaming Encounter, their
own Horses turned Tails with such fury, as by their violence overthrew
<i>Jeremy</i> and his Army, without any loss at all to speak of to <i>Meldritch.</i>
But of this Victory, long they triumphed not; for being within three
Leagues of <i>Rottenton,</i> the <i>Tartar,</i> with near forty thousand so beset
them, that they must either fight, or be cut in pieces flying. Here
<i>Busca,</i> and the Emperour had their desire; for the Sun no sooner
displayed his Beams, than the <i>Tartar</i> his Colours; where at mid-day he
stayed a while, to see the Passage of a tyrannical and treacherous
imposture, till the Earth did blush with the blood of Honesty, that the
Sun for shame did hide himself, from so monstrous sight of a cowardly
Calamity. It was a most brave sight to see the Banners and Ensigns
streaming in the Air, the glittering of Armour, the variety of Colours,
the motion of Plumes, the forests of Lances, and the thickness of shorter
Weapons, till the silent Expedition of the bloody blast from the murdering
Ordnance, whose roaring Voice is not so soon heard, as felt by the aimed
at Object, which made among them a most lamentable slaughter.</p>

<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps">In the valley</span> of <i>Veristhorne,</i> betwixt the River of <i>Altus,</i> and the
Mountain of <i>Rottenton,</i> was this bloody Encounter, where the most of the
dearest Friends of the noble Prince Sigismundus perished. <i>Meldritch</i>
having ordered his Eleven thousand in the best manner he could, at the
Foot of the Mountain upon his Flanks, and before his front, he had pitched
sharp Stakes, their Heads hardned in the fire, and bent against the Enemy,
as three Battalion of Pikes, amongst the which also, there was digged many
small holes. {MN-1} Amongst those Stakes was ranged his foot-men, that
upon the charge was to retire, as there was occasion. The <i>Tartar</i> having
ordered his 40000 for his best advantage, appointed <i>Mustapha Bashaw</i> to
begin the Battel, with a general Shout, all their Ensigns displaying,
Drums beating, Trumpets and Haut-boys sounding. <i>Nederspolt</i> and <i>Mavazo</i>
with their Regiments of Horse most valiantly encountred, and forced them
to retire; the <i>Tartar Begoli</i> with his Squadrons, darkning the Skies with
their flights of numberless Arrows, who was as bravely encountred by
<i>Veltus</i> and <i>Oberwin,</i> which bloody slaughter continued more than an
hour, till the matchless multitude of the <i>Tartars</i> so increased, that
they retired within their Squadrons of Stakes, as was directed. The bloody
<i>Tartar,</i> as scorning he should stay so long for the Victory, with his
massie Troops prosecuted the Charge: But it was a wonder to see how Horse
and Man came to the Ground among the Stakes, whose disordered Troops were
there so mangled, that the <i>Christians</i> with a loud Shout cried
<i>Victoria;</i> and with five or six field Pieces, planted upon the rising of
the Mountain, did much hurt to the Enemy that still continued the Battel
with that fury, that <i>Meldritch</i> seeing there was no possibility long to
prevail, joyned his small Troops in one body, resolved directly to make
his passage, or die in the conclusion; and thus in gross gave a general
charge, and for more than half an hour, made his way plain before him,
till the main Battle of the <i>Crim-Tartar,</i> with two Regiments of <i>Turks</i>
and <i>Jaizaries</i> so overmatched them, that they were overthrown. The night
approaching, the Earl with some thirteen or fourteen hundred Horse, swam
the River, some were drowned, all the rest slain or taken Prisoners: And
thus in this bloody Field, near 30000 lay, some Headless, Armless and
Legless, all cut and mangled; where breathing their last, they gave this
knowledge to the World, that for the lives of so few, the <i>Crim-Tartar</i>
never paid dearer. {MN-2} But now the Countries of <i>Transilvania</i> and
<i>Wallachia</i> (subjected to the Emperor) and <i>Sigismundus,</i> that brave
Prince, his Subject and Pensioner, the most of his Nobility, brave
Captains and Soldiers, became a prey to the cruel devouring <i>Turk:</i> where,
had the Emperour been as ready to have assisted him, and  those three
Armies led by three such worthy Captains, as <i>Michael, Busca,</i> and Himself,
and had those three Armies joyned together against the <i>Turk,</i> let all Men
judge, how happy it might have been for all Christendom: and have either
regained <i>Bulgaria,</i> or at least have beat him out of <i>Hungaria,</i> where he
hath taken much more from the Emperour, than hath the Emperour from
<i>Transilvania.</i></p>

many a gasping Soul, with toil and Wounds lay groaning among the rest,
till being found by the Pillagers, he was able to live, and perceiving by
his Armour and Habit, his ransom might be better to them than his Death,
they led him Prisoner with many others; well they used him till his Wounds
were cured, and at <i>Axopolis</i> they were all sold for Slaves, like Beasts
in a Market-place, where every Merchant, viewing their Limbs and Wounds,
caused other Slaves to struggle with them, to try their strength, he fell
to the share of <i>Bashaw Bogal,</i> who sent him forthwith to <i>Adrianopolis,</i>
so for <i>Constantinople</i> to his fair Mistriss for a Slave. By twenty and
twenty chained by the Necks, they marched in file to this great City,
where they were delivered to their several Masters, and he to the young

<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps">This Noble</span> Gentlewoman took sometime occasion to shew him to some Friends,
or rather to speak with him, because she could speak Italian, would feign
her self sick when she should go to the <i>Bannians,</i> or weep over the
Graves, to know how <i>Bogal</i> took him Prisoner; and if he were as the

many others, which ere long he would present her, whose Ransomes should
adorn her with the glory of his Conquests.</p>

<p>But when she heard him protest he knew no such matter, nor ever saw

To try the truth, she found means to find out many who could speak

<p>{MN-1} Here now let us remember his passing, in this speculative course
from <i>Constantinople</i> by <i>Sander, Screw, Panassa, Musa, Lastilla,</i> to
<i>Varna,</i> an ancient City upon the <i>Black Sea.</i> In all which Journey,
having little more liberty, than his eyes judgment, since his Captivity,
he might see the Towns with their short Towers, and a most plain, fertile,
and delicate Country, especially that most admired place of <i>Greece,</i> now
called <i>Romania,</i> but from <i>Varna,</i> nothing but the <i>Black Sea</i> Water,
till he came to the two Capes of <i>Taur</i> and <i>Pergilos,</i> where he passed
the Streight of <i>Niger,</i> which (as he conjectured) is some ten Leagues
long, and three broad, betwixt two Low-lands, the Channel is deep, {MN-2}
but at the entrance of the Sea <i>Dissabacca,</i> there are many great
Osie-shaulds, and many great black Rocks, which the <i>Turks</i> said were
Trees, Weeds, and Mud, thrown from the In-land Countries, by the
Inundations and violence of the Current, and cast there by the Eddy. They
Sailed by many low Isles, and saw many more of those muddy Rocks, and
nothing else, but salt Water, till they came betwixt <i>Sufax</i> and
<i>Curuske,</i> only two white Towns at the entrance of the River <i>Bruapo</i>
appeared: In six or seven days Sail, he saw four or five seeming strong
Castles of Stone, with flat tops and Battlements about them, but arriving
at <i>Cambia,</i> he was (according to their custom) well used. The River was
there more than half a Mile broad. The Castle was of a large
Circumference, fourteen or fifteen foot thick, in the Foundation some six
foot from the Wall, is a <i>Pallizado,</i> and then a Ditch of about forty foot
broad full of Water. On the West side of it, is a Town, all of low flat
Houses, which as he conceived, could be of no great strength, yet it keeps
all them barbarous Countreys about it in admiration and subjection. After
he had stayed there three days; it was two days more before his Guides
brought him to <i>Nalbrits,</i> where the <i>Tymor</i> was then resident, in a great
vast Stone Castle, with many great Courts about it, invironed with high
Stone Walls, where was quartered their Arms, when they first subjected
those Countries, which only live to labour for those Tyrannical <i>Turks.</i></p>

Brother, diverted all this to the worst of Cruelty; for within an hour
after his arrival, he caused his <i>Drubman</i> to strip him naked, and shave
his Head and Beard so bare as his Hand, a great Ring of Iron, with a long
stalk bowed like a Sickle, revitted about his Neck, and a Coat made of
<i>Ulgries</i> Hair, guarded about with a piece of an undrest Skin. There were
many more Christian Slaves, and near an hundred <i>Forsados</i> of <i>Turks</i> and

<i>Burracho's,</i> which though it be never so sower, it agreeth well with

One or two thousand of those glittering white Carts drawn with Camels,

<p>{MN-1} <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Now you</span> are to understand, <i>Tartary</i>  and <i>Scythia</i> are all one,
but so large and spacious, few, or none, could ever perfectly describe it,
nor all the several kinds of those most barbarous People that inhabit it.
Those we call the <i>Crim-Tartars,</i> border upon <i>Moldavia, Podolia,
Lithuania,</i> and <i>Russia,</i> are much more regular than the interior parts of
<i>Scythia.</i> This Great <i>Tartarian</i> Prince, that hath so troubled all his
Neighbours, they always call <i>Chan,</i> which signifieth Emperour; but we,
the <i>Crim-Tartar.</i> He liveth for the most part in the best Champion Plains
of many Provinces; and his removing Court is like a great City of Houses
and Tents, drawn on Carts, all so orderly placed East and West, on the
right and left hand of the Prince's House, which is always in the midst
towards the South, before which, none may pitch their Houses, every one
knowing their Order and Quarter, as in an Army. {MN-2} The Princes Houses
are very artificially wrought, both the Foundation, Sides, and Roof of
Wickers, ascending round to the top like a Dove coat; this they cover with
white Salt, or white Earth, temper'd with the Powder of Bones, that it
may shine the whiter; sometimes with black Felt, curiously painted with
Vines, Trees, Birds, and Beasts; the breadth of the Carts are eighteen or
twenty Foot, but the house stretcheth four or five Foot over each side,
and is drawn with ten or twelve, or for more state, twenty Camels and
Oxen. {MN-3} They have also great Baskets, made of smaller Wickers, like
great Chests, with a covering of the same, all covered over with black
Felt, rubbed over with Tallow and Sheep's Milk, to keep out the Rain;
prettily bedecked with Painting or Feathers; in those they put their
Houshold Stuff and Treasure, drawn upon other Carts for that purpose. When
they take down their Houses, they set the door always towards the South,
and their Carts thirty or forty Foot distant on each side, East and West,
as if they were two Walls: The Women also have most curious Carts; every
one of his Wives hath a great one for her self, and so many other for her
Attendants, that they seem as many Courts as he hath Wives. One great
<i>Tartar</i> or Nobleman, will have for his particular, more than an hundred
of those Houses and Carts, for his several Offices and Uses, but set so
far from each other, they will seem like a great Village. {MN-4} Having
taken their Houses from the Carts, they place the Master always towards
the North; over whose head is always an Image like a Puppet, made of Felt,
which they call his Brother; the Women on his left hand, and over the
chief Mistriss her Head, such another Brother, and between them a little
one, which is the keeper of the House; at the good Wives Beds-feet is a
Kids Skin, stuffed with Wooll, and near it a Puppet looking towards the
Maids; next the door another, with a dried Cows Udder, for the Women that
Milk the Kine, because only the Men Milk Mares; {MN-5} every Morning those
Images in their orders, they besprinkle with that they drink, be it
Cossmos, or whatsoever, but all the white Mares Milk is reserved for the
Prince. Then without the door, thrice to the South, every one bowing his
knee in honour of the Fire; then the like to the East, in honour of the
Air; then to the West, in honour of the Water; and lastly to the North, in
behalf of the dead. After the Servant hath done this duty to the four
quarters of the World, he returns into the House, where his Fellows stand
waiting, ready with two Cups, and two Basons, to give their Master, and
his Wife that lay with him that Night, to wash and drink, who must keep
him company all the day following, and all his other Wives come thither to
drink, where he keeps his House that day; and all the Gifts presented him
till night, are laid up in her Chests; and at the door a Bench full of
Cups, and drink for any of them to make merry.</p>

and Herbs they can get, but the more variety of wild ones is the best; to
which they have excellent Drink made of Rice, Millet, and Honey, like
Wine; they have also Wine, but in Summer they drink most Cossmos, that
standeth ready always at the entrance of the door, and by it a Fidler;
when the Master of the House beginneth to drink, they all cry, ha, ha, and
the Fidler plays, then they all clap their Hands and dance, the Men before
their Masters, the Women before their Mistresses; and ever when he drinks,
they cry as before; then the Fidler stayeth till they drink all round;
sometimes they will drink for the Victory; and to provoke one to drink,
they will pull him by the Ears, and lug and draw him, to stretch and beat
him, clapping their Hands, stamping with their Feet, and dancing before
the Champions, offering them Cups, then draw them back again to increase
their Appetite; and thus continue till they be drunk, or their drink done,
which they hold an honour, and no Infirmity.</p>

 <p class="quote">{MN} <i>Their Feasts.</i></p>


<p>{MN} Though the Ground be fertile, they sow little Corn, yet the Gentlemen
have Bread and Honey-wine; Grapes they have plenty, and Wine privately,
and good Flesh and Fish; but the common sort stamped Millet, mingled with
Milk and Water. They call Cassa for Meat, and drink any thing; also any
Beast unprofitable for service they kill, when they are like to die, or
however they die, they will eat them, Guts, Liver and all; but the most
fleshy parts they cut in thin slices, and hang it up in the Sun and Wind
without salting, where it will dry so hard, it will not putrifie in a long
time. A Ramm they esteem a great Feast among forty or fifty, which they
cut in pieces boiled or roasted, puts it in a great Bowl, with Salt and
Water, for other Sawce they have none; the Master of the Feast giveth
every one a piece, which he eateth by himself, or carrieth away with him.
{MN-2} Thus their hard fare makes them so infinite in Cattel, and their
great number of Captive Women to breed upon, makes them so populous. But
near the Christian Frontiers, the baser sort make little Cottages of Wood,
called <i>Vlusi,</i> daubed over with dirt, and Beasts dung covered with sedge;
yet in Summer they leave them, beginning their Progress in <i>April,</i> with
their Wives, Children, and Slaves, in their Carted Houses, scarce
convenient for four or five Persons; driving their Flocks towards
<i>Precopia,</i> and sometimes into <i>Taurica,</i> or <i>Osow,</i> a Town upon the River
<i>Tanais,</i> which is great and swift, where the <i>Turk</i> hath a Garrison; and
in <i>October</i> return again to their Cottages. Their Clothes are the Skins
of Dogs, Goats, and Sheep, lined with Cotton Cloath, made of their finest
Wooll, for of their worst they make their Felt, which they use in
abundance, as well for Shooes and Caps, as Houses, Beds, and Idols; also
of the coarse Wooll mingled with Horse hair, they make all their Cordage.
{MN-3} Notwithstanding this wandring life, their Princes sit in great
State upon Beds, or Carpets, and with great reverence are attended both by
Men and Women, and richly served in Plates and great Silver Cups,
delivered upon the Knee, attired in rich Furrs, lined with Plush, or
Taffity, or Robes of Tissue. These <i>Tartars</i> possess many large and goodly
Plains, wherein feed innumerable Herds of Horse and Cattel, as well wild
as tame; which are Elkes, Bisons, Horses, Deer, Sheep, Goats, Swine,
Bears, and divers others.</p>

his intent to all his Subjects, within a Month commonly he raiseth his

is parched Millet, or ground to Meal, which they ordinarily mingle with
Water (as is said) hard Cheese or Curds dried, and beaten to powder, a
little will make much Water like Milk, and dried Flesh, this they put also
up in Sacks; The Chan and his Nobles have some Bread and <i>Aquavit&aelig;,</i> and
quick Cattel to kill when they please, wherewith very sparingly they are
contented. Being provided with expert Guides, and got into the Country he
intends to Invade, he sends forth his Scouts to bring in what Prisoners
they can, from whom he will wrest the utmost of their Knowledge fit for
his purpose; having advised with his Council, what is most fit to be done,
the Nobility, according to their Antiquity, doth march; then moves he with
his whole Army: if he find there is no Enemy to oppose him, he adviseth
how far they shall Invade, commanding every Man (upon pain of his Life) to
kill all the obvious Rusticks; but not to hurt any Women, or Children.</p>

convenient for his standing Camp; the rest of his Army he divides in
several Troops, bearing ten or twelve Miles square before them, and ever
within three or four days return to their Camp, putting all to Fire and
Sword, but that they carry with them back to their Camp; and in this
scattering manner he will invade a Country, and be gone with his Prey,
with an incredible Expedition. But if he understand of an Enemy, he will
either fight in Ambuscado, or flie; for he will never fight any Battel if
he can chuse, but upon treble advantage; yet by his innumerable flights of
Arrows, I have seen flie from his flying Troops, we could not well judge,
whether his fighting or flying was most dangerous, so good is his Horse,
and so expert his Bow-men; but if they be so intangled they must fight,
there is none can be more hardy, or resolute in their defences.</p>

will accept of some particular Person they best like for themselves) the
rest are divided amongst the whole Army, according to every Mans Desert
and Quality; that they keep them, or sell them to who will give most; but
they will not forget to use all the means they can, to know their Estates,
Friends, and Quality, and the better they find you, the worse they will
use you, till you do agree to pay such a Ransom, as they will impose upon
you; therefore many great Persons have endured much misery to conceal
themselves, because their Ransoms are so intolerable: their best hope is
of some Christian Agent, that many times cometh to redeem Slaves, either
with Money, or Man for Man; those Agents knowing so well the extream
covetousness of the <i>Tartars,</i> do use to bribe some Jew or Merchant, that
feigning they will sell them again to some other Nation, are oft redeemed
for a very small Ransom.</p>

follow him, so that from all those <i>Tartars</i> he hath had an Army of an
hundred and twenty thousand excellent, swift, stomackfull <i>Tartarian</i>
Horse for foot they have none. Now the Chan, his Sultans and Nobility, use

Helmets; Bows and Arrows they make most themselves, also their Bridles and
Saddles are indifferent, but the Nobility are very handsome, and well
armed like the <i>Turks,</i> in whom consisteth their greatest Glory; the
ordinary sort have little Armour, some a plain young Pole unshaven, headed
with a piece of Iron for a Lance; some an old <i>Christian</i> Pike, or a
<i>Turks</i> Cavarine, yet those Tattertimallions will have two or three
Horses, some four or five, as well for service, as for to eat; which makes
their Armies seem thrice so many as there are Soldiers. The Chan himself
hath about his Person, Ten thousand chosen <i>Tartars</i> and <i>Janizaries,</i>
some small Ordnance, and a white Mares Tail, with a piece of green Taffity
on a great Pike, is carried before him for a Standard; because they hold
no Beast so precious as a white Mare, whose Milk is only for the King and
Nobility, and to Sacrifice to their Idols; but the rest have Ensigns of

the great Ocean; it hath many great Rivers which fall into it, as the
mighty River of <i>Volga,</i> which is like a Sea, running near Two thousand
Miles, through many great and large Countries, that send into it many
other great Rivers; also out of <i>Saberia, Yaick,</i> and <i>Yem,</i> out of the
great Mountain <i>Caucasus,</i> the River <i>Sirus, Arash,</i> and divers others,
yet no Sea nearer it than the black Sea, which is at least an hundred
Leagues distant: In which Country live the <i>Georgians,</i> now part
<i>Armenians,</i> part <i>Nestorians;</i> it is neither found to increase or
diminish, or empty it self any way, except it be under Ground, and in some
places they can find no Ground at Two hundred fathom.</p>

<p>{MN-1} <span style="font-variant:small-caps">All the hope</span> he had ever to be delivered from this Thraldom, was
Only the love of <i>Tragabigzanda,</i> who surely was ignorant of his bad
usage; for although he had often debated the matter with some Christians,
that had been there a long time Slaves, they could not find how to make an
escape, by any reason or possibility; but God beyond Man's Expectation or
Imagination helpeth his Servants, when they least think of help, as it
hapned to him. So long he lived in this miserable Estate, as he became
a Thresher at a grange in a great Field, more than a League from the
<i>Timor's</i> House; the <i>Bashaw,</i> as he oft used to visit his Granges,
visited him, and took occasion so to beat, spurn, and revile him, that
forgetting all reason, he beat out the <i>Timor's</i> Brains with his Threshing
Bat, for they have no Flails; and seeing his Estate could be no worse than
it was, clothed himself in his Clothes, hid his Body under the Straw,
filled his Knapsack with Corn, shut the doors, mounted his Horse, and ran
into the Desart at all adventure; two or three days, thus fearfully
wandring he knew not whither, and well it was, he met not any to ask the
way; being even as taking leave of this miserable World, {MN-2} God did
direct him to the great way or Castragan, as they call it, which doth
cross these large Territories, and generally known among them by these
marks.</p>

 <p class="quote">{MN-1} <i>How</i> Smith <i>escaped his Captivity.</i></p>

 <p class="quote">{MN-2} <i>Their Guides in those Countries.</i></p>


<p>In every crossing of this great way is planted a Post, and in it so many
bobs with broad ends, as there be ways, and every bob the Figure painted
on it, that demonstrateth to what part that way leadeth; as that which
pointeth towards the <i>Crim's</i> Country, is marked with a half Moon, if
towards the <i>Georgians</i> and <i>Persia,</i> a black Man, full of white spots, if
towards <i>China,</i> the Picture of the Sun, if towards <i>Muscovia,</i> the Sign
of a Cross, if towards the Habitation of any other Prince, the Figure
whereby his Standard is known. To his dying Spirits thus God added some
comfort in this melancholy Journey, wherein if he had met any of that vile
Generation, they had made him their Slave, or knowing the Figure Engraven
in the Iron about his Neck, (as all Slaves have) he had been sent back
again to his Master; sixteen days he travelled in this fear and torment,
after the Cross, till he arrived at <i>&AElig;copolis,</i> upon the River <i>Don,</i> a
Garrison of the <i>Muscovites.</i> The Governour after due Examination of those
his hard events, took off his Irons, and so kindly used him, he thought
himself new risen from the Dead, and the good Lady <i>Calamata,</i> largely
Supplied all his wants.</p>

<p>{MN-1} This is as much as he could learn of those wild Countries, that the
Country of <i>Cambia</i> is two days Journey from the Head of the great River
<i>Bruapo,</i> which springeth from many places of the Mountains of
<i>Innagachi,</i> that joyn themselves together in the Pool <i>Kerkas</i> which
they account for the Head, and falleth into the Sea <i>Dissabacca,</i> called
by some the Lake <i>Maeotas,</i> which receiveth also the River <i>Tanais,</i> and
all the Rivers that fall from the great Countries of the <i>Circassi,</i> the
<i>Cartaches,</i> and many from the <i>Tauricaes, Precopes, Cummani, Cossunka,</i>
and the <i>Crim;</i> through which Sea he Sailed, and up the River <i>Bruapo</i> to
<i>Nalbrits,</i> and thence through the Desarts of <i>Circassi</i> to <i>&AElig;copolis,</i>
as is related; where he stayed with the Governour, till the Convoy went to
<i>Caragnaw;</i> then with his Certificate how he found him, and had examined
with his friendly Letters, sent him by <i>Zumalack</i> to <i>Caragnaw,</i> whose
Governour in like manner so kindly used him, that by this means he went
with a safe conduct to <i>Lesch,</i> and <i>Donko,</i> in <i>Cologoske,</i> and thence to
<i>Berniske</i>, and <i>Newgrod</i> in <i>Siberia,</i> by <i>Rezechica,</i> upon the River
<i>Nieper,</i> in the confines of <i>Lithuania;</i> from whence with as much
kindness, he was convoyed in like manner by <i>Coroski, Duberesko, Duzihell,
Drohobus,</i> and <i>Ostroge</i> in <i>Volonia; Saslaw,</i> and <i>Lasco</i> in <i>Podolia;
Halico</i> and <i>Collonia</i> in <i>Polonia;</i> and so to <i>Hermonstat</i> in
<i>Transilvania.</i> In all this his life, he seldom met with more Respect,
Mirth, Content and Entertainment; and not any Governour where he came, but
gave him somewhat as a Present, besides his Charges; seeing themselves as
subject to the like Calamity. {MN-2} Through those poor continually
Foraged Countries, there is no passage, but with the Caravans or Convoys;
for they are Countries rather to be pitied than envied; and it is a wonder
any should make Wars for them. The Villages are only here and there, a few
Houses of streight Firr Trees, laid heads and points above one another,
made fast by notches at the ends, more than a Man's heighth, and with
broad split Boards, pinned together with woodden Pins, as thatched for
coverture. In ten Villages you shall scarce find ten Iron Nails, except it
be in some extraordinary Man's House. For their Towns, <i>&AElig;copolis, Letch,</i>
and <i>Donko,</i> have Rampires made of that woodden Walled fashion, double,
and betwixt them Earth and Stones, but so latched with cross Timber, they
are very strong against any thing but Fire; and about them a deep Ditch,
and a Palizado of young Firr Trees; but most of the rest have only a great
Ditch cast about them, and the Ditches Earth, is all their Rampire; but
round, well environed with Palizadoes. Some have some few small pieces of
small Ordnance, and Slings, Calievers, and Muskets, but their generallest
Weapons are the <i>Russe</i> Bows and Arrows; you shall find Pavements over
Bogs, only of young Firr-Trees, laid cross one over another, for two or
three hours Journey, or as the Passage requires, and yet in two days
Travel, you shall scarce see six Habitations. Notwithstanding to see how
their Lords, Governours, and Captains are civilized, well attired and
accoutred with Jewels, Sables, and Horses, and after their manner with
curious Furniture, it is wonderful; but they are all Lords or Slaves,
which makes them so subject to every Invasion.</p>

<p>In <i>Transilvania,</i> he found so many good Friends, that but to see, and
rejoyce himself (after all those Encounters) in his Native Country, he
would ever hardly have left them, though the mirrour of vertue their

Captain and some twelve more went to <i>Morocco,</i> to see the ancient
Monuments of that large renowned City: It was once the principal City in
<i>Barbary,</i> situated in a goodly plain Country, 14 Miles from the great
Mount <i>Atlas,</i> and sixty Miles from the <i>Atlantick</i> Sea; but now little
remaining, but the King's Palace, which is like a City of it self; and the
Christian Church, on whose flat, {MN-1} square Steeple is a great broach
of Iron, whereon is placed the three Golden Balls of Africa: The first is
near three Ells in Circumference, the next above it somewhat less, the
uppermost the least over them, as it were an half Ball, and over all a
pretty gilded Pyramid. Against those Golden Balls hath been shot many a
shot, their Weight is recorded 700 weight of pure Gold, hollow within, yet
no shot did ever hit them, nor could ever any Conspirator attain that
Honour as to get them down. They report, the Prince of <i>Morocco</i>
betrothed himself to the King's Daughter of <i>&AElig;thiopia,</i> he dying before
their Marriage, she caused those three Golden Balls to be set up for his
Monument, and vowed Virginity all her Life. {MN-2} The <i>Alfantica</i> is also
a place of note, because it is invironed with a great Wall, wherein lie
the Goods of all the Merchants securely guarded. The <i>Inderea</i> is also (as
it were) a City of it self, where dwell the Jews: The rest for the most
part is defaced; but by the many Pinnacles and Towers, with Balls on their
tops, hath much appearance of much sumptuousness and curiosity. There have
been many famous Universities, which are now but Stables for Fowls, and
Beasts, and the Houses in most parts lie tumbled one above another; the
Walls of Earth are with the great fresh Floods washed to the ground; nor
is there any Village in it, but Tents for Strangers, <i>Larbes</i> and <i>Moors.</i>
Strange Tales they will tell of a great Garden, wherein were all sorts of
Birds, Fishes, Beasts, Fruits, and Fountains, which for Beauty, Art and
Pleasure, exceeded any place known in the World, though now nothing but
Dung-hills, Pigeon-Houses, Shrubs and Bushes. There are yet many excellent
Fountains, adorned with Marble, and many Arches, Pillars, Towers, Ports,

condemned to have his Tongue cut out, and his Hand cut off: But no sooner
it was known at the King's Court, but 300 of his Guard came, and broke
open the Prison, and delivered him although the Fact was next degree to
Treason.</p>

<p>{MN} Concerning this <i>Archer,</i> there is one thing more worth noting: Not
far from Mount <i>Atlas,</i> a great Lioness in the heat of the day, did use to
bathe her self, and teach her young Puppies to swim in the River
<i>Cauzef,</i> of a good breadth; yet she would carry, which some <i>Moors</i>
perceiving, watched there them one after another over the River;
opportunity, and when the River was between her and them, stole four of
her Whelps, which she perceiving, with all the speed she could passed the
River, and coming near them, they let fall a Whelp (and fled with the
rest) which she took in her mouth, and so returned to the rest: A Male
and a Female of those they gave Mr. <i>Archer,</i> who kept them in the King's
Garden, till the Male killed the Female, then he brought it up as a
Puppy-dog lying upon his Bed, till it grew so great as a Mastiff, and no
dog more tame or gentle to them he knew: But being to return for
<i>England,</i> at <i>Saffee</i> he gave him to a Merchant of <i>Marseillses,</i> that
presented him to the French King, who sent him to King James, where it was
kept in the Tower seven Years: After one Mr. <i>John Bull,</i> then Servant to
Mr. <i>Archer,</i> with divers of his Friends, went to see the Lions, not
knowing any thing at all of him; yet this rare Beast smelled him before he
saw him, whining, groaning, and tumbling, with such an expression of
acquaintance, that being informed by the Keepers how he came thither; Mr.
<i>Bull</i> so prevailed, the Keeper opened the Grate, and <i>Bull</i> went in: But
no Dog could fawn more on his Master, than the Lion on him, licking his
Feet, Hands, and Face, skipping and tumbling to and fro, to the wonder of
all the beholders; being satisfied with his acquaintance, he made shift to
get out of the Grate: But when the Lion saw his Friend gone, no Beast by
bellowing, roaring, scratching, and howling, could express more rage and
sorrow, nor in four days after would he either eat or drink.</p>

<p>{MN} In <i>Morocco,</i> the King's Lions are altogether in a Court, invironed
with a great high Wall; to those they put a young Puppy-dog: The greatest
Lion had a sore upon his neck, which this Dog so licked, that he was
healed: The Lion defended him from the fury of all the rest, nor durst
they eat till the Dog and he had fed; this Dog grew great, and lived
amongst them many years after.</p>

called <i>Fez,</i> divided into two parts; old <i>Fez</i>, containing about 80
thousand Households, the other 4000 pleasantly situated upon a River in
the heart of <i>Barbary,</i> part upon Hills, part upon Plains, full of people,
and all sorts of Merchandize. The great Temple is called <i>Carucen</i>, in
breadth seventeen Arches, in length 120, born up with 2500 white Marble
Pillars: under the chief Arch, where the Tribunal is kept, hangeth a most
huge Lamp, compassed with 110 lesser, under the other also hang great
Lamps, and about some, are burning fifteen hundred lights, They say, they
were all made of the Bells the <i>Arabians</i> brought from <i>Spain.</i> It hath
three Gates of notable heighth, Priests and Officers so many, that the
Circuit of the Church, the Yard, and other Houses, is little less than a
Mile and half in compass, there are in this City 200 Schools, 200 Inns,
400 Water-Mills, 600 Water-Conduits, 700 Temples and Oratories; but 50 of
them most stately and richly furnished. Their <i>Alcazer</i> or <i>Burse</i> is
Walled about, it hath twelve Gates, and fifteen Walks covered with Tents,
to keep the Sun from the Merchants, and them that come there. The King's
Palace, both for strength and beauty is excellent, and the Citizens have
many great Privileges. Those two Countries of <i>Fez</i> and <i>Morocco,</i> are the
best part of all <i>Barbary,</i> abounding with People, Cattel, and all good
Necessaries for Man's use. For the rest, as the <i>Larbs,</i> or Mountainers,
the Kingdoms of <i>Cocow, Algier, Tripoli, Tunis,</i> and <i>&AElig;gypt;</i> there are
many large Histories of them in divers Languages, especially that writ by
that most excellent Statesman, <i>John de Leo,</i> who afterwards turned
Christian. {MN-2} The unknown Countries of <i>Guine</i> and <i>Binn,</i> this six
and twenty years have been frequented with a few English Ships only to
Trade, especially the River of <i>Senega,</i> by Captain <i>Brimstead,</i> Captain
<i>Brockit,</i> Mr. <i>Crump,</i> and divers others. Also the great River of
<i>Gambia,</i> by Captain <i>Johnson,</i> who is returned in thither again, in the
Year 1626, with Mr. <i>William Grent,</i> and thirteen or fourteen others, to
stay in the Country, to discover some way to those rich Mines of <i>Gago</i> or
<i>Tumbatu,</i> from whence is supposed the <i>Moors</i> of <i>Barbary</i> have their
Gold, and the certainty of those supposed Descriptions and Relations of
those interiour parts, which daily the more they are sought into, the more
they are corrected: For surely, those interiour Parts of Africa, are
little known to either <i>English, French,</i> or <i>Dutch,</i> though they use much
the Coast; therefore we will make a little bold with the Observations of
the <i>Portugals.</i></p>

along this Western Shoar of <i>Africa,</i> to find passage to the
<i>East-Indies,</i> within this hundred and fifty years, even from the
Streights of <i>Gibraltar,</i> about the Cape of <i>Bone Esperance</i> to the
<i>Persian</i> Gulf, and thence all along the <i>African</i> Coast to the
<i>Moluccas,</i> have subjected many great Kingdoms, erected many
Common-wealths, built many great and strong Cities; and where is it they
have not been by Trade or Force? No not so much as <i>Cape de Verd,</i> and
<i>Sermleone;</i> but most Bays or Rivers, where there is any Trade to be had,
especially Gold, or conveniency for Refreshment, but they are scattered;
living so amongst those Blacks, by time and cunning, they seem to be
naturalized amongst them. As for the Isles of the <i>Canaries,</i> they have
fair Towns, many Villages, and many thousands of People rich in
Commodities.</p>

himself for <i>Congo</i> to Trade, where he found such Entertainment, finding
the King much oppressed with Enemies, he found means to bring in the

and spent most of his life to bring those Countries to the Crown of

<p>{MN} The Kingdom of <i>Congo</i> is about 600 Miles Diameter any way, the chief
City called St. <i>Savadore,</i> seated upon an exceeding high Mountain, 150
Miles from the Sea, very fertile, and Inhabited with more than 100000
Persons, where is an excellent Prospect over all the plain Countries about
it, well watered, lying (as it were) in the Center of this Kingdom, over
all which the <i>Portugals</i> now command, though but an handful in comparison
of <i>Negroes.</i> They have Flesh and Fruits very plentiful of divers sorts.</p>

 <p class="quote">{MN} <i>The Kingdom of</i> Congo.</p>


<p>{MN} This Kingdom is divided into five Provinces, viz. <i>Bamba, Sundi,
Pango, Batta</i> and <i>Pembo;</i> but <i>Bamba</i> is the Principal, and can afford
400000 Men of War. Elephants are bred over all those Provinces, and of
wonderful greatness; though some report, they cannot kneel, nor lie down,
they can do both, and have their Joynts as other Creatures for use: With
their Fore-feet they will leap upon Trees to pull down the Boughs, and are
of that strength, they will shake a great <i>Cocao</i> Tree for the Nuts, and
pull down a good Tree with their Tusks, to get the Leaves to eat, as well
as Sedge and long Grass, <i>Cocao</i> Nuts and Berries, &amp;c. which with their
Trunk they put in their Mouth, and chew it with their smaller Teeth; in
most of those Provinces, are many rich Mines, but the <i>Negroes</i> opposed
the <i>Portugueses</i> for working in them.</p>

<p>{MN} The Kingdom of <i>Angola</i> is wonderful populous, and rich in Mines of
Silver, Copper, and most other Metals; fruitfull in all manner of Food,
and sundry sorts of Cattel, but Dogs Flesh they love better than any other
Meat; they use few Clothes, and no Armour; Bows, Arrows, and Clubs are
their Weapons. But the <i>Portugueses</i> are well armed against those Engines,
and do buy yearly of those Blacks more than five thousand Slaves, and many

about them. Their Arms are Bows; short and small, wrapped about with
Serpents Skins, of divers Colours, but so smooth, you would think them all
one with the Wood, and it makes them very strong; their Strings little
twigs, but exceeding tough and flexible; their Arrows short, which they
shoot with an incredible quickness. They have short Axes of Brass and
Copper for Swords; wonderful, loyal and faithful, and exceeding simple,
yet so active, they skip amongst the Rocks like Goats. {MN-2} They trade
with them of <i>Nubea,</i> and <i>Congo,</i> for <i>Lamach,</i> which is a small kind of
Shell-fish, of an excellent azure, colour, Male and Female, but the Female
they hold most pure; they value them at divers prices, because they are of
divers sorts, and those they use for Coin, to buy and sell, as we do Gold
and Silver; nor will they have any other Money in all those Countries, for
which they give Elephants Teeth; and Slaves for Salt, Silk, Linen Cloth,
Glass-beads, and such like <i>Portugal</i> Commodities.</p>

Beef, or other Victuals; for when they cannot have a good Market for their
Slaves; or their Enemies they take, they kill, and sell them in this
manner; some are so resolute, in shewing how much they scorn death, they
will offer themselves and Slaves, to this Butchery to their Prince and
Friends; and though there be many Nations will eat their Enemies, in

say, is white; for there are no Saints but Blacks.</p>

<p>{MN} But besides those great Kingdoms of <i>Congo, Angola,</i> and <i>Azichi,</i> in
those unfrequented Parts are the Kingdoms of <i>Lango, Matania, Battua,
Sofola, Mozambeche, Quivola,</i> the Isle of St. <i>Lawrence, Mombaza,

with whom they have a kind of Trade, and their Rites, Customs, Climates,
Temperatures, and Commodities by Relation. Also of great Lakes, that
deserve the Names of Seas, and huge Mountains of divers sorts, as some
scorched with heat, some covered with Snow; the Mountains of the Sun, also
of the Moon, some of Chrystal, some of Iron, some of Silver, and Mountains
of Gold, with the Original of <i>Nilus;</i> likewise sundry sorts of Cattel,
Fishes, Fowls, strange Beasts, and monstrous Serpents; for Africa was
always noted to be a fruitful Mother of such terrible Creatures; who
meeting at their watering places, which are but Ponds in desart places, in
regard of the heat of the Country, and their extremities of Nature, make
strange Copulations, and so ingender those extraordinary Monsters. Of all
these you may read in the History, of this <i>Edward Lopez,</i> translated into
English by <i>Abraham Hartwel,</i> and dedicated to <i>John</i> Lord Arch-bishop of
<i>Canterbury,</i> 1597. But because the Particulars are most concerning the
conversion of those Pagans, by a good poor Priest, that first converted a
Noble Man, to convert the King, and the rest of the Nobility; sent for so
many Priests and Ornaments into <i>Portugal,</i> to Solemnize their Baptisms
with such Magnificence, which was performed with such strange Curiosities,
that those poor <i>Negro's</i> adored them as gods, till the Priests grew to
that Wealth, a Bishop was sent to rule over them, which they would not
endure, which endangered to spoil all before they could be reconciled. But
not to trouble you too long with those Rarities of uncertainties; let us
return again to <i>Barbary,</i> where the Wars being ended, and <i>Befferres</i>
possessed of <i>Morocco,</i> and his Fathers Treasure, a new bruit arose
amongst them, that <i>Muly Sidan</i> was raising an Army against him, who after
took his Brother <i>Befferres</i> Prisoner; but by reason of the uncertainty,
and the perfidious, treacherous, bloody murthers rather than War, amongst
those perfidious, barbarous Moors, <i>Smith</i> returned with <i>Merham,</i> and the
rest to <i>Saffe,</i> and so aboard his Ship, to try some other conclusions at
Sea.</p>

<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps"><i>Merham,</i></span> a Captain of a Man of War then in the Road, invited Captain
<i>Smith,</i> and two or three more of them aboard with him, where he spared
not any thing he had to express his kindness, to bid them welcome, till it
was too late to go on Shoar, so that necessity constrained them to stay
aboard; a fairer Evening could not be, yet ere Midnight, such a Storm did
arise, they were forced to let slip Cable, and Anchor, and put to Sea;
spooning before the Wind, till they were driven to the <i>Canaries;</i> in the
Calms they accommodated themselves, hoping this strange accident might yet
produce some good event; not long it was before they took a small Bark
coming from <i>Tenerif,</i> loaded with Wine; three or four more they chased,
two they took, but found little in them, save a few Passengers, that told
them of five <i>Dutch</i> Men of War, about the Isles, so that they stood for
<i>Boiadora,</i> upon the <i>African</i> Shoar, betwixt which and <i>Cape Noa,</i> they
descryed two Sail. <i>Merham</i> intending to know what they were, hailed them;
very civilly they danced their Top-sails, and desired the Man of War to
come aboard them, and take what he would, for they were but two poor
distressed <i>Biskainers.</i> But <i>Merham</i> the old Fox, seeing himself in the
Lions paws, sprung his louf, the other tacked after him, and came close up
to his nether Quarter, gave his Broad-side, and so loufed up to Windward;
the Vice-Admiral did the like, and at the next bout, the Admiral with a
noise of Trumpets, and all his Ordnance, Murtherers, and Muskets, boarded
him on his Broad-side, the other in like manner on his ley Quarter, that
it was so dark, there was little light, but fire and smoak; long he stayed
not, before he, fell off, leaving 4 or 5 of his Men sprawling over the
Grating; after they had battered <i>Merham</i> about an hour, they boarded him
again as before, and threw four Kedgars or Grapnels in Iron Chains, then
shearing off, they thought so to have torn down the Grating; but the
Admiral's Yard was so intangled in their Shrouds, <i>Merham</i> had time to
discharge two cross barr shot amongst them, and divers Bolts of Iron made
for that purpose, against his Bow, that made such a Breach, he feared they
both mould have sunk for Company; so that the <i>Spaniard</i> was as yare in
slipping his chained Grapnels, as <i>Merham</i> was in cutting the Tackling,
kept fast their Yards in his Shrouds; the Vice-Admiral presently cleared
himself, but spared neither his Ordnance nor Muskets to keep <i>Merham</i> from
getting away, till the Admiral had repaired his Leak; from twelve at noon,
till six at night, they thus interchanged one volly for another; then the
Vice-Admiral fell on Stern, staying for the Admiral that came up again to
him, and all that night stood after <i>Merham,</i> that shaped his course for
<i>Mamora,</i> but such small way they made, the next Morning they were not
three Leagues off from <i>Cape Noa.</i> The two <i>Spanish</i> Men of War, for so
they were, and well appointed, taking it in scorn as it seemed, with their
Chase, Broad-side, and Stern, the one after the other, within Musket shot,
plying their Ordnance; and after an hours Work, commanded <i>Merham</i> amain
for the King of Spain upon fair Quarter; <i>Merham</i> drank to them, and so
discharged his Quarter Pieces. Which Pride the <i>Spaniard</i> to revenge,
boarded him again, and many of them were got to the top to unsling the
Main-Sail, which the Master and some others from the Round-House, caused
to their cost to come tumbling down; about the Round-House the <i>Spaniards</i>
so pestred, that they were forced to the great Cablen and blew it up; the
smoak and fire was so vehement, as they thought the Ship on fire; they in
the Fore-Castle were no less assaulted, that they blew up a piece of the
Grating, with a great many of <i>Spaniards</i> more; then they cleared
themselves with all speed, and <i>Merham</i> with as much Expedition to quench
the Fire with wet Cloaths and Water, which began to grow too fast. The
<i>Spaniard</i> still playing upon him with all the shot they could; the open
Places presently they covered with old Sails, and prepared themselves to
fight to the last Man. The Angry <i>Spaniard</i> seeing the fire quenched, hung
out a Flag of truce to have but a Parley; but that desperate <i>Merham</i> knew
there was but one way with him, and would have none, but the report of his
Ordnance, which he did know well how to use for his best Advantage. Thus
they spent the next Afternoon, and half the Night, when the <i>Spaniards</i>
either lost them or left them. Seven and twenty Men <i>Merham</i> had slain and
sixteen wounded, and could find they had received 140 great shot. A
wounded <i>Spaniard</i> they kept alive confessed, they had lost 100 Men in
the Admiral, which they did fear would sink ere she could recover a Port.
Thus Re-accommodating their Sails, they failed for <i>Sancta Cruse, Cape
Goa,</i> and <i>Magadore,</i> till they came again to <i>Safee,</i> and then he
returned into England.</p>

   this present</i> 1629.</p>


<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Concerning</span> these Countries, I would be  sorry to trouble you with
repeating one thing twice, as with their Mapps, Commodities, People,
Government and Religion yet known; the beginning of these Plantations,
their Numbers and Names, with the Names of the Adventures, the Yearly
proceedings of every Governour both here and there. As for the
Misprisions, Neglect, Grievances, and the causes of all these Rumours,
losses and crosses that have happened; I refer you to the General History,
where you shall find all this at large; especially to those Pages where
you may read my Letter of Advice to the Councel and Company, what of
necessity must be done, or lose all and leave the Country, Pag. 70. what
Commodities I sent home, Pag. 163. my Opinion and offer to the Company, to
feed and defend the Colonies, Pag. 150. my Account to them here of my
Actions there, Pag. 163. and seven Answers to his Majesty's Commissioners:
Seven Questions what hath hindered <i>Virginia,</i> and the remedy, Pag. 165.
How those Noble Gentlemen spent near two Years in perusing all Letters
came from thence; and the differences betwixt many Factions, both here and
there, with their Complaints; especially about the <i>Sallery</i> which should
have been a new Office in <i>London,</i> for the well ordering the sale of
<i>Tobacco,</i> that 2500 Pounds should Yearly have been raised out of it, to
pay four or five Hundred Pounds Yearly to the Governour of that Company,
two or three Hundred to his Deputy; the rest into Stipends of forty or
fifty Pounds Yearly for their Clerks and other Officers which were never
there, Pag. 153. but not one Hundred Pounds for all them in <i>Virginia,</i>
nor any thing for the most part of the Adventures in <i>England,</i> except the
undertakers for the Lotteries, Setters out of Ships, Adventures of
Commodities, also their Factors and many other Officers, there imployed
only by friendship to raise their Fortunes out of the Labours of the true
Industrious Planters by the Title of their Office, who under the colour of
sincerity, did pillage and deceive all the rest most cunningly: For more
than 150000 Pounds have been spent out of the Common Stock, besides many
thousands have been there Consumed, and near 7000 People that there died,
only for want of good Order and Government, otherwise long ere this there
would have been more than 20000 People, where after twenty Years spent
only in Complement and trying new Conclusions, was remaining scarce 1500,
with some few Cattel.</p>

<p>Then the Company dissolved, but no Account of any thing; so that his
Majesty appointed Commissioners to oversee, and give Order for their
Proceedings. Being thus in a manner left to themselves, since then within
these four Years, you shall see how wonderfully they have increased beyond
expectation; but so exactly as I desired, I cannot relate unto you: For
altho' I have tired my self in seeking and discoursing with those returned
thence, more than would a Voyage to <i>Virginia;</i> few can tell me any thing,
but of that Place or Places they have Inhabited, and he is a great
Traveller that hath gone up and down the River of <i>James</i> Town, been at
<i>Pamaunk, Smith's</i> Isles, or <i>Accomack;</i> wherein for the most part, they
keep one tune of their now particular abundance, and their former wants
having been there, some sixteen Years, some twelve, some six, some near
twenty, &amp;c. But of their general Estate, or any thing of worth, the most
of them doth know very little to any purpose.</p>

<p>{MN} Now the most I could understand in general, was from the Relation of
Mr. <i>Nathaniel Cawsey,</i> that lived there with me, and returned <i>Anno Dom.</i>
1627. and some others affirm; Sir <i>George Yerely</i> was Governour, Captain
<i>Francis West,</i> Doctor <i>John Pott,</i> Captain <i>Roger Smith,</i> Captain
<i>Matthews,</i> Captain <i>Tucker,</i> Mr. <i>Clabourn,</i> and Mr. <i>Farrer,</i> of the
Council: their Habitations many. The Governour, with two or three of the
Council, are for most part at <i>James</i> Town, the rest repair thither as
there is occasion; but every three Months they have a general Meeting, to
consider of their Publick Affairs.</p>

<p>{MN} Their Numbers then were about 1500, some say rather 2000, divided
into seventeen or eighteen several Plantations; the greatest part thereof
towards the falls, are so inclosed with Pallisadoes they regard not the
<i>Salvages.</i> and amongst those Plantations above <i>James</i> Town, they have
now found means to take plenty of Fish, as well with Lines as Nets, and
where the Waters are the largest, having Means they need not want.</p>

many times their Fires: yet some few there are, that upon their
opportunity, have slain some few straglers, which have been revenged with

seldom kill any other, &amp;c. And every one is so applied to his labour about
Tobacco and Corn, which doth yield them such Profit, they never regard any
food from the <i>Salvages,</i> nor have they any Trade or Conference with them,
but upon meer Accidents and Defiances: And now the Merchants have left it,
there having gone so many voluntary Ships within these two Years, as have
furnished them with Apparel, Sack, <i>Aquavit&aelig;,</i> and all necessaries, much

contagious by many, now they have Houses, Lodgings, Victuals, and the Sun
hath Power to Exhale up the moist Vapours of the Earth, where they have
cut down the Wood, which before it could not, being covered with spreading

<p>{MN-1} Since this, Sir <i>George Yerely</i> died 1628, Captain <i>West</i> Succeeded
him; but about a Year after, returned for <i>England.</i> Now Doctor <i>Poor</i> is
Governour, and the rest of the Council as before: <i>James</i> Town is yet
their chief Seat, most of the Wood destroyed, little Corn there Planted,
but all Converted into Pasture and Gardens, wherein doth grow all manner
of Herbs and Roots we have in <i>England,</i> in abundance, and as good Grass
as can be. Here most of their Cattle do feed, their Owners being most some
one way, some another, about their Plantations, and return again when they
please, or any Shipping comes in to Trade. Here in the Winter they have
Hay for their Cattel, but in other Places they Browze upon Wood, and the
great husks of their Corn, with some Corn in them, doth keep them well.
{MN-2} Mr. <i>Hutchins</i> saith, they have 2000 Cattle, and about 5000 People,
but <i>Master Floud, John Davis, William Emerson,</i> and divers others say,
about 5000 People, and 5000 Kine, Calves, Oxen and Bulls; for Goats, Hoggs
and Poultry, Corn, Fish, Dear, and many sorts of other wild Beasts; and
Fowl in their Season, they have so much more than they spend, they are
able to feed three or four Hundred more than they have; and do oft much
relieve many Ships, both there, and for their Return; and this last Year
was there at least two or three and Twenty Sale. They have oft much
Salt-fish from <i>New England,</i> but fresh Fish enough, when they will take
it; Peaches in abundance at <i>Kecoughtan;</i> Apples, Pears, Apricocks, Vines,
Figgs, and other Fruits some have Planted that prospered exceedingly, but
their Diligence about Tobacco, left them to be spoiled by the Cattel, yet
now they begin to Revive; {MN-3} Mrs. <i>Pearce,</i> an Honest Industrious
Woman, hath been there near twenty Years, and now returned, saith, she
hath a Garden at <i>James</i> Town, containing three or four Acres, where in
one Year she hath gathered near an Hundred Bushels of excellent Figgs; and
that of her own Provision she can keep a better House in <i>Virginia,</i> than
here in <i>London</i> for 3 or 400 Pounds a Year, yet went thither with little
or nothing. They have some tame Geese, Ducks and Turkies. The Masters now
do so train up their Servants and Youth in shooting Deer and Fowl, that
the Youths will kill them as well as their Masters. They have two
Brew-houses, but they find the <i>Indian</i> Corn so much better than ours,
they begin to leave sowing it. Their Cities and Towns are only scattered
Houses, they call Plantations, as are our Country Villages; but no
Ordnance Mounted. The Forts Captain <i>Smith</i> left a Building, so ruined,
there is scarce Mention where they were; no Discoveries of any thing more,
than the curing of Tobacco, by which hitherto, being so present a
Commodity of Gain, it hath brought them to this abundance; but that they
are so disjointed, and every one Commander of himself to Plant what he
will: {MN-4} they are now so well provided, that they are able to subsist;
and if they would join together, now to work upon Soap, Ashes, Iron,
Rape-Oil, Mader, Pitch and Tarr, Flax and Hemp; as for their Tobacco,
there comes from many Places such abundance, and the charge so great, it
is not worth the bringing home.</p>

<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps">From</span> the <i>Summer Isles,</i> Mr. <i>Ireland,</i> and divers others report, their
Forts, Ordnance and Proceedings, are much as they were in the Year 1622.
as you may read in the General History, Pag. 199. Captain <i>Woodhouse</i>
Governour. There are few sorts of any Fruits in the West Indies, but they
grow there in abundance; yet the fertility of the Soil in many Places
decayeth, being Planted every Year, for their Plantains, which is a most
delicate Fruit, they have lately found a way by Pickling or Drying them,
to bring them over into <i>England,</i> there being no such Fruit in <i>Europe,</i>
and wonderful for increase. For Fish, Flesh, Figgs, Wine, and all sorts of
most excellent Herbs, Fruits and Roots they have in abundance. In this
Governour's time, a kind of Whale, or rather a Jubarta, was driven on
Shoar in <i>Southampton</i> Tribe from the West, over an Infinite Number of
Rocks so bruised, that the Water in the Bay where she lay, was all Oily,
and the Rocks about it all Bedasht with Parmacitty, congealed like Ice, a
good quantity we gathered, with which we commonly cured any Boil, Hurt or
Bruise; some burnt it in their Lamps, which blowing out, the very snuff
will burn so long as there is any of the Oil remaining, for two or three

<p>The next Governour was Captain <i>Philip Bell,</i> whose time being expired,
Captain <i>Roger Wood</i> possess'd his Place, a worthy Gentleman of good
desert, and hath lived a long time in the Country; their Numbers are about
2 or 3000 Men, Women and Children, who increase there exceedingly; their
greatest Complaint is want of Apparel, and too much Custom, and too many
Officers; the Pity is, there are no more Men than Women, yet no great
Mischief, because there is so much less Pride: the Cattle they have
increase exceedingly; their Forts are well maintain'd by the Merchants
here, and Planters there; to be brief, this Isle is an excellent Bit to
Rule a great Horse.</p>

<p>All the Cohow Birds and Egbirds are gone; seldom any wild Catts seen; no
Rats to speak off; but the Worms are yet very troublesome; the People very
healthful, and the Ravens gone; Fish enough, but not so near the shoar as
it used, by the much beating it; it is an Isle that hath such a Rampire
and a Ditch, and for the quantity so manned, Victualled, and Fortified, as
few in the World do exceed it, or is like it.</p>

<p>{MN} The 22d of March, two Ships came from thence; the

Mr. <i>Anthony Thorne,</i> a smaller Ship, were chased by eleven Ships of

<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps">When</span> I went first to the North part of <i>Virginia,</i> where the Westerly
Colony had been planted, it had dissolved it self within a Year, and there
was not one <i>Christian</i> in all the Land. I was set forth at the sole
Charge of four Merchants of <i>London;</i> the Country being then reputed by
your Westerlings, a most Rocky Barren, Desolate Desart; {MN-1} but the
good Return brought from thence, with the Maps and Relations I made of the
Country, which I made so manifest, some of them did believe me, and they
were well embraced both by the <i>Londoners</i> and the <i>Westerlings,</i> for whom
I had promised to undertake it, I thinking to have joined them all
together, but that might well have been a work of <i>Hercules.</i> Betwixt them
long there was much contention; the <i>Londoners</i> indeed went bravely
forward; but in three or four Years, I and my Friends consumed many
hundred Pounds amongst the <i>Plimothians,</i> who only fed me with delays,
promises and excuses, but no Performance of any thing to any purpose. In
the interim, many particular Ships went thither, and finding my Relations
true, and that I had not taken that I brought home from the <i>French</i> Men,
as had been reported; yet further, for my Pains to discredit me, and my
calling it <i>New-England,</i> they obscured, and shadowed it, with the Title
of <i>Canada,</i> till at my humble suit, it pleased our most Royal King
<i>Charles,</i> whom God long keep, bless and preserve, then Prince of <i>Wales,</i>
to confirm it with my Map and Book, by the Title of <i>New England;</i> the
gain thence returning, did make the same thereof so increase, that thirty,
forty, or fifty sail went Yearly only to Trade and Fish; but nothing would
be done for a Plantation, till about some Hundred of your Brownists of
<i>England, Amsterdam</i> and <i>Leyden,</i> went to <i>New Plimouth,</i> whose humorous
Ignorances, caused them for more than a Year to endure a wonderful deal of
misery, with an infinite patience; saying my Books and Maps were much
better cheap to teach them than my self; {MN-2} many other have used the
like good Husbandry, that have payed soundly in trying their self-will'd
conclusions; but those in time doing well, divers others have in small
handfuls undertaken to go there, to be several Lords and Kings of
themselves, but most vanished to nothing; notwithstanding the Fishing
Ships, made such good returns, at last it was ingrossed by twenty
Patentees, that divided my Map into twenty parts, and cast Lots for their
shares; but Money not coming in as they expected, procured a Proclamation,
none should go thither without their Licences to Fish; but for every
thirty Tuns of Shipping, to pay them five Pounds; besides, upon great
Penalties, neither to Trade with the Natives, cut down Wood for their
Stages, without giving satisfaction, though all the Country is nothing but
Wood, and none to make use of it, with many such other pretences, for to
make this Country plant it self, by its own Wealth: Hereupon most Men grew
so discontented, that few or none would go; so that the Patentees, who
never a one of them had been there, seeing those Projects Would not
prevail, have since not hindred any to go that would, that within these
few last years, more have gone thither than ever.</p>

Judge <i>Doderege;</i> the Right Honourable Earls of <i>Pembroke, Southampton,
Salisbury,</i> and the rest, as I take it, they did all think, as I and them
went with me, did; That had those two Countries been planted, as it was
intended, that no other Nation should complant betwixt us. If ever the
King of <i>Spain</i> and we should fall foul, those Countries being so capable
of all Materials for shipping, by this might have been Owners of a good
Fleet of Ships, and to have relieved a whole Navy from <i>England</i> upon
occasion; yea, and to have furnished <i>England</i> with the most Easterly
Commodities; and now since, seeing how conveniently the <i>Summer Isles</i>
fell to our shares, so near the <i>West-Indies,</i> we might with much more
facility than the <i>Dutch</i> Men have invaded the <i>West-Indies,</i> that doth
now put in practice, what so long hath been advised on, by many an honest
<i>English</i> States-man.</p>

<p>{MN} Those Countries, Captain <i>Smith</i> oft times used to call his Children
that never had Mother; and well he might, for few Fathers ever payed
dearer for so little content; and for those that would truly understand,
how many strange Accidents hath befallen them and him; how oft up, how oft
down, sometimes near despair, and ere long flourishing, cannot but
conceive Gods infinite Mercies and Favours towards them. Had his Designs
been to have perswaded Men to a Mine of Gold, though few doth conceive
either the charge or pains in refining it, nor the power nor care to
defend it; or some new Invention to pass to the South Sea, or some strange
Plot to invade some strange Monastery, or some portable Country, or some
chargeable Fleet to take some rich Carocks in the <i>East-Indies;</i> of
Letters of Mart to rob some poor Merchants; What multitudes of both People
and Money would contend to be first imployed? But in those noble
endeavours (now) how few of quality, unless it be to beg some Monopoly;
and those seldom seek the common good, but the Commons Goods, as you may
read at large in his general History, <i>pag.</i> 217, 218, 219, his general
Observations and Reasons for this Plantation; for yet those Countries are
not so forward, but they may become as miserable as ever, if better
courses be not taken than is; as this <i>Smith</i> will plainly demonstrate to
his Majesty, or any other noble Person of Ability, liable generously to
undertake it; how within a Short time to make <i>Virginia</i> able to resist
any Enemy, that as yet lieth open to all, and yield the King more Custom
within these few years, in certain staple Commodities, than ever it did in
Tobacco; which now not being worth bringing home, the Custom will be as
uncertain to the King, as dangerous to the Plantation.</p>

degrees, and coasted the Coast, and searched up the River <i>Oranoco;</i> where
understanding that twenty several Voyages had been made by the Spaniards;
in discovering this Coast and River, to find a passage to the great City
of <i>Mano,</i> called by them the <i>Eldorado,</i> or the Golden City: he did his
utmost to have found some better Satisfaction than Relations: {MN-1} But
means failing him, he left his trusty Servant <i>Francis Sparrow</i> to seek
it, who wandring up and down those Countries, some fourteen or fifteen
years, unexpectedly returned; I have heard him say, he was led blinded
into this City by <i>Indians;</i> but little Discourse of any purpose, touching
the largeness of the report of it; his body seeming as a Man of an
uncurable Consumption, shortly died here after in <i>England.</i> There are
above thirty fair Rivers that fall into the Sea, between the River of
<i>Amazons</i> and <i>Oranoco,</i> which are some nine degrees asunder. {MN-2} In

Men in the River <i>Weapoco,</i> and so presently returned to <i>England,</i> where
he obtained by the favour of Prince <i>Henry</i> a large Patent for all that
Coast called <i>Guiana,</i> together with the famous River of <i>Amazons,</i> to him
and his Heirs: but so many troubles here surprized him, though he did his
best to supply them, he was not able, only some few he sent over as
Passengers, with certain <i>Dutch</i> Men, but to small purpose. Thus this
business lay dead for divers years, till Sir <i>Walter Rawleigh,</i>
accompanied with many valiant Soldiers and brave Gentlemen, went his last
Voyage to <i>Guiana,</i> amongst the which, was Captain <i>Roger North,</i> Brother
to the Right Honourable the Lord <i>Dudley North,</i> who upon this Voyage,
having stayed, and seen divers Rivers upon this Coast, took such a liking
to those Countries, having had before this Voyage, more perfect and

rich, from thence in good Commodities, they would not go with Sir <i>Walter
Rawleigh</i> in search of Gold; that after his return for <i>England</i>, he
endeavoured by his best Abilities to interest his Country and State in

arrived well in the <i>Amazons,</i> only with the loss of one old Man: Some
hundred Leagues they ran up the River to settle his Men, where the sight
of the Country and People so contented them, that never Men thought
themselves more happy: Some <i>English</i> and <i>Irish</i> that had lived there

and to leave the <i>Dutch:</i> having made a good Voyage, to the value of more
than the charge, he returned to <i>England</i> with divers good Commodities,
besides, Tobacco: So that it may well be conceived, that if this Action
had not been thus crossed the Generality of <i>England</i> had by this time
been won and encouraged therein. But the time was not yet come, that God
would have this great business effected, by reason of the great Power the
Lord <i>Gundamore,</i> Ambassadour for the King of <i>Spain,</i> had in <i>England,</i>
to cross and ruin those Proceedings, and so unfortunate Captain <i>North</i>
was on this business, he was twice committed Prisoner to the Tower, and
the Goods detained, till they were spoiled, who beyond all others, was by
much the greatest Adventurer and Loser.</p>

<p>{MN} Notwithstanding all this, those that he had left in the <i>Amazons,</i>
would not abandon the Country. Captain <i>Thomas Painton,</i> a worthy
Gentleman; his Lieutenant dead. Captain <i>Charles Parker,</i> Brother to the
Right Honourable the Lord <i>Morley,</i> lived there six years after; Mr.
<i>John Christmas,</i> five years; so well, they would not return, although
they might, with divers other Gentlemen of Quality and others: All thus
destitute of any supplies from <i>England.</i> But all Authority being
dissolved, want of Government did more wrong their Proceedings, than all
other crosses whatsoever. Some relief they had sometime from the <i>Dutch,</i>
who knowing their Estates, gave what they pleased, and took what they
list. Two Brothers, Gentlemen, <i>Thomas</i> and <i>William Hixon,</i> who stayed
three years there, are now gone to stay in the <i>Amazons,</i> in the Ships
lately sent thither.</p>

<p>The business thus remaining in this fort, three private Men left of that
Company, named Mr. <i>Thomas Warriner, John Rhodes,</i> and <i>Robert Bims,</i>
having lived there about two years, came for <i>England,</i> and to be free
from the disorders that did grow in the <i>Amazons,</i> for want of Government
amongst their Country-men, and to be quiet amongst themselves, made means
to let themselves out for St. <i>Christophers;</i> their whole number being but
fifteen Persons that payed for their Passage in a Ship going for
<i>Virginia,</i> where they remained a year before they were supplied, and then
that was but four or five Men. Thus this Isle, by this small beginning,
having no interruption by their own Country, hath not got the start of the
Continent and main Land of <i>Guinea,</i> which hath been laid apart, and let
alone until that Captain <i>North,</i> ever watching his best opportunity and
advantage of time in the State, hath now again pursued, and set on foot
his former design. Captain <i>Harcote</i> being now willing to surrender his
Grant, and to joyn with Captain <i>North,</i> in passing a new Patent, and to
erect a Company for Trade and Plantation in the <i>Amazons,</i> and all the
Coast and Country of <i>Guinea</i> for ever. Whereupon, they have sent this
present year in <i>January,</i> and since 1628, four Ships, with near two
hundred Persons; the first Ship with 112 Men, not one miscarried; the rest
went since, not yet heard of and are preparing another with their best
Expedition; and since <i>January</i> is gone from <i>Holland,</i> 100 <i>English</i> and
<i>Irish,</i> conducted by the old Planters.</p>

<p>This great River lieth under the Line, the two chief Head Lands North and
South, are about three degrees asunder, the mouth of it is so full of many
great and small Isles, it is an easie matter for an unexperienced Pilot to
lose his way. It is held one of the greatest Rivers in <i>America,</i> and as
most Men think in the World; and cometh down with such a fresh, it maketh
the Sea fresh, more than thirty Miles from the Shoar. Captain <i>North</i>
having seated his Men about an hundred Leagues in the Main, sent Captain
<i>William White,</i> with thirty Gentlemen and others, in a Pinnace of thirty
Tun, to discover further, which they did some two hundred Leagues, where
they found the River to divide it self in two parts, till then all full of
Islands, and a Country most healthful, pleasant and fruitful; for they
found food enough, and all returned safe and in good health: In this
discovery, they saw many Towns well inhabited, some with three hundred
People, some with five, six, or seven hundred; and of some they understood
to be of so many thousands, most differing very much, especially in their
Languages: Whereof they suppose by those <i>Indians,</i> they understand are
many hundreds more, unfrequented till then by any <i>Christian,</i> most of
them stark naked, both Men, Women and Children, but they saw not any such
Giant-like Women as the Rivers name importeth. But for those where Captain
<i>North</i> hath seated his Company, it is not known where Indians were ever
so kind to any Nation, not sparing any pains, danger or labour, to feed
and maintain them. The <i>English</i> following their Buildings, Fortifications
and Sugar-works; for which they have sent most expert Men, and with them
all things necessary for that purpose; to effect which, they want not the
help of those kind Indians to produce; and many other good Commodities,
which (God willing) will ere long make plain and apparent to this Kingdom,
and all the Adventures and Well-willers to this Plantation, to be well
worthy the cherishing and following with all alacrity.</p>

Friends, and lived with the <i>Indians</i> a Month, then we built a Fort, and a
House, and planting Fruits, by <i>September</i> we made a crop of Tobacco;
{MN-2} but upon the nineteenth of <i>September</i> came a <i>Hericano</i> and blew
it away, all this while we lived upon Cassada Bread, Potatoes, Plantanes,
Pines, Turtles, Guanes, and Fish plenty; for drink we had <i>Nicnobby.</i></p>

other of the <i>Caribbe</i> Isles, and that there were six Peryagoes, which
are huge great Trees, formed as your Canoos, but so laid out on the sides
with Boards, they will seem like a little Gally: {MN} Six of those, with
about four or five hundred strange <i>Indians</i> came unto us, we bade them be
gone, but they would not; whereupon we and the <i>French</i> joyned together,
and upon the fifth of <i>November</i> set upon them, and put them to flight:
upon New years Even they came again, found three <i>English</i> going about the

{MN-2} but upon the fourth of September, came such a Hericano, as blew
down all our Houses, Tobacco, and two Drums into the air we know not
whither, drove two Ships on Shoar that were both split; all our Provision
thus lost, we were very miserable, living only on what we could get in the

aboard for Provision, but in their returning home, eight <i>French</i> Men were

The 26th of <i>October,</i> came in Captain <i>William Smith,</i> in the

store of all Commodities to relieve the Plantation; but by reason some

away with them all the Tobacco, he was forced to put away all his
Commodities upon trust till the next crop; in the mean time he resolved
there to stay, and imploy himself and his Company in planting Tobacco,
hoping thereby to make a Voyage, but before he could be ready to return
for <i>England,</i> a <i>Hericano</i> happening, his Ship was split, to his great
loss, being sole Merchant and owner himself, notwithstanding forced to pay
to the Governour the fifth part of his Tobacco, and for fraught to
<i>England,</i> three pence a pound, and nine pence a pound custom, which
amounts together to more than threescore pound in the hundred pound, to
the great discouragement of him and many others, that intended well to
those Plantations. Nevertheless he is gone again this present year 1629,
with a Ship of about three hundred Tuns, and very near two hundred People,
with Sir <i>William Tuffton</i> Governour for the <i>Barbadoes</i>, and divers
Gentlemen, and all manner of Commodities fit for a Plantation.</p>

<i>English, French,</i> and <i>Dutch</i> Ships, and all the <i>Indians</i> forced out of
the Isle, for they had done much mischief amongst the <i>French,</i> in cutting
their Throats, burning their Houses, and spoiling their Tobacco; amongst
the rest <i>Tegramund,</i> a little Child, the King's Son, his Parents being
slain, or fled, was by great chance saved, and carefully brought to

<p>{MN-1} It lieth seventeen degrees Northward of the Line, about an hundred
and twenty Leagues from the <i>Cape de tres Puntas,</i> the nearest main Land
in <i>America,</i> it is about eight Leagues in length, and four in breadth;
an Island amongst 100 Isles in the <i>West Indies,</i> called the <i>Caribbes,</i>
where ordinarily all them that frequent the <i>West Indies,</i> refresh
themselves; those, most of them are Rocky, little, and Mountainous, yet
frequented with the <i>Canibals;</i> many of them inhabited, as Saint
<i>Domingo,</i> Saint <i>Mattalin,</i> Saint <i>Lucia,</i> Saint <i>Vincent, Granada,</i> and
<i>Margarita,</i> to the Southward; Northward, none but Saint <i>Christophers,</i>
and it but lately, yet they will be ranging <i>Marigalanta, Guardalupo,
Deceado, Mountserat, Antegua, Mevis, Bernardo,</i> Saint <i>Martin,</i> and Saint
<i>Bartholomew,</i> but the worst of the four Isles possessed by the
<i>Spaniard,</i> as <i>Portorico</i> or <i>Jamaica,</i> is better than them all; as for
<i>Hispaniola,</i> and <i>Cuba,</i> they are worthy the Title of two rich Kingdoms,
the rest not respected by the <i>Spaniards,</i> for want of Harbours, and their
better choice of good Land, and profit in the main. But Captain <i>Warner,</i>
having been very familiar with Captain <i>Painton,</i> in the <i>Amazon,</i> hearing
his information of this St. <i>Christophers;</i> and having made a years trial,
as it is said, returned for <i>England,</i> joyning with Master <i>Merifield</i> and
his Friends, got Letters Patents from King James to plant and possess it.
Since then, the Right Honourable the Earl of <i>Carlisle</i> hath got Letters
Patents also, not only of that, but all the <i>Caribe</i> Isles about it, who
is now chief Lord of them, and the <i>English</i> his Tenants that do possess
them; over whom he appointeth such Governours and Officers as their
affairs require; and although there be a great Custom imposed upon them,
considering their other charges, both to feed and maintain themselves; yet
there is there, and now a going, near upon the number of three thousand
People; where by reason of the rockiness and thickness of the Woods in the
Isle, it is difficult to pass, and such a snuff of the Sea goeth on the
Shoar, ten may better defend, than fifty assault. {MN-2} In this Isle are
many Springs, but yet Water is scarce again in many places; the Valleys
and sides of the Hills very fertile, but the Mountains harsh, and of a
sulphurous composition; all overgrown with <i>Palmetas, Cotten</i> Trees;
<i>Lignum vit&aelig;,</i> and divers other sorts, but none like any in Christendom,
except those carried thither; the air very pleasant and healthful, but
exceeding hot, yet so tempered with cool breaths, it seems very temperate
to them, that are little used to it; the Trees being always green, the
days and nights always very near equal in length, always Summer; only they
have in their Seasons great Gusts and Rains, and sometimes a Hericano,
which is an over grown, and a most violent storm.</p>

Beast, like a <i>Crocodile,</i> or <i>Alligator,</i> very fat and good Meat; she
lays Eggs in the Sand, as doth the Land Crabs, which live here In

upon a shrub, and beareth a Cod bigger than a Walnut, full of Cotten wool:
Anotto also groweth upon a shrub, with a Cod like the other, and nine or
ten on a bunch, full of Anotto, very good for Dyers, tho' wild; Sugar
Canes, not tame, four or five foot high; also Mastick, and Locus-trees;
great and hard Timber, Gourds, Musk-Melons, Water-Melons, Lettice, Parsly;
all places naturally bear Purslain of it self; Sope-berries like a Musquet

great store of exceeding great Locus-trees, two or three Fathom about, of

which hath always ripe Fruit Flowers, or Green Fruit, which will refresh
two or three Men, and very comfortable; Plumb-trees many, the Fruit great
and Yellow, which but strained into Water in four and twenty hours, will
be very good drink; wild Figg-trees there are many; all those Fruits do
fat the Hoggs, yet at sometimes of the Year they are so lean as Carrion;
Guane-trees bear a Fruit so big as a Pear, good and wholsom; Palmetaes of
three several sorts; Pappaws, Prickle Pears, good to eat or make drink;
Cedar Trees very tall and great; Fustick Trees are very great, and the
wood yellow, good for dying; Soap Berries, the kernel so big as a sloe,

great Bottles, and cut in two pieces, good Dishes and Platters; many small
Brooks of very good Water; <i>Guinea</i> Wheat, Cassado, Pines and Plantains;
all things we there Plant, do grow exceedingly, so well as Tobacco; the
Corn, Pease, and Beans, cut but away the Stalk, young sprigs will grow,

<p>{MN-1} <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Because</span> I have ranged and lived amongst those Islands, what my
Authors cannot tell me, I think it no great error in helping them to tell
it my self. In this little Isle of <i>Mevis,</i> more than twenty Years ago, I
have remained a great time together, to Wood and Water and refresh my Men;
it is all Woody, but by the Sea-side Southward, there are Sands like
Downs, where a Thousand Men may quarter themselves Conveniently; but in
most places the Wood groweth close to the Water side, at a high Water
mark, and in some places so thick of a soft spungy Wood like a wild
Fig-tree, you cannot get through it, but by making your way with Hatchets,
or Fauchions: whether it was the dew of those Trees, or of some others, I
am not certain, but many of our Men became so tormented with a burning
swelling all over their Bodies, they seemed like scalded Men, and near Mad
with Pain; {MN-2} here we found a great Pool wherein bathing themselves
they found much ease; and finding it fed with a Pleasant small stream that
came out of the Woods, we found the head half a Mile within the Land
distilling from many Rocks, by which they were well cured in two or three
days. Such factions here we had, as commonly attend such Voyages, that a
pair of Gallows were made, but Captain <i>Smith</i> for whom they were
intended, could not be perswaded to use them; but not any one of the
inventors, but their lives by Justice fell into his Power to determine of
at his Pleasure, whom with much Mercy he favoured, that most basely and
unjustly have betrayed him.</p>

 <p class="quote">{MN-1} <i>The Description of the Isle.</i></p>

 <p class="quote">{MN-2} <i>The Bath.</i></p>


<p>{MN} The last Year 1628. Mr. <i>Littleton</i> with some others, got a Patent of
the Earl of <i>Carlisle</i> to Plant the Isle called the <i>Barbadoes,</i> thirty
Leagues Northward of St. <i>Christophers;</i> which by report of their
Informers, and Undertakers, for the excellency of the Pleasantness
thereof, they called <i>Dulcina,</i> but when they came there, they found it
such a Barren Rock they left it; altho they were told as much before, they
would not believe it, perswading themselves those contradicters would get
it for themselves, was thus by their cunning Opinion, the deceivers of
themselves; for seeing it lie conveniently for their purpose in a Map,
they had not Patience to know the goodness or badness, the inconvenience
nor probability of the Quantity nor Quality; which error doth predominate
in most of our homebred Adventurers, that will have all things as they
conceit and would have it; and the more they are contradicted, the more
hot they are; but you may see by many Examples in the general History, how
difficult a matter it is, to gather the Truth from amongst so many Foreign
and several Relations, except you have exceeding good experience both of
the Countries People, and their Conditions; and those ignorant
undertakings, have been the greatest hindrance of all those Plantations.</p>

                              <hr width="80%">

 <p class="quote">{MN} <i>A great misfortune.</i></p>


<p>{MN} At last because they would be absolute, they came to <i>Mevis,</i> a
little Isle by St. <i>Christophers;</i> where they seated themselves, well
furnished with all necessaries, being about the Number of an Hundred, and
since increased to an Hundred and fifty Persons, whereof many were old
Planters of St. <i>Christophers;</i> especially Mr. <i>Anthony Hinton,</i> and Mr.
<i>Edward Tompson.</i> But because all those Isles for the most part are so
capable to produce, and in Nature like each other, let this discourse
serve for the description of them all. Thus much concerning those
Plantations, which now after all this time, loss and charge, should they
be abandon'd, suppressed, and dissolved, were most lamentable; and surely
seeing they all strive so much about this Tobacco, and that the Fraught
thereof, and other charges are so great, and so open to any Enemy by that
Commodity they cannot long subsist.</p>

                              <hr width="80%">

 <p class="quote">{MN} <i>Their Numbers.</i></p>


<p>And it is a wonder to me to see such Miracles and Mischiefs in Men; how
greedily they pursue to dispossess the Planters of the Name of Christ
Jesus, yet say they are Christians, when so much of the World is
unpossessed; yea, and better Land than they so much strive for, murthering
so many Christians, burning and spoiling so many Cities, Villages and
Countries, and subverting so many Kingdoms, when so much lieth wait, or
only possessed by a few poor Savages, that more serve the Devil for fear,
than God for love; whose Ignorance we pretend to reform, but Covetousness,
Humours, Ambition, Faction, and Pride hath so many Instruments, we perform
very little to any purpose; nor is there either Honour or Profit to be got
by any that are so vile, to undertake the subversion, or hinderance of any
honest intended Christian Plantation.</p>

<p>{MN} Now to conclude the Travels and Adventures of Captain <i>Smith;</i> how
first he Planted <i>Virginia</i> and was let ashoar with about an Hundred Men
in the wild Woods; how he was taken Prisoner by the Savages, by the King
of <i>Pamaunke</i> tied to a Tree to be shot to death, led up and down their
Country to be shewed for a wonder; fatted as he thought, for a Sacrifice
for their Idol, before whom they conjured him three days, with strange
Dances and Invocations, then brought him before their Emperor <i>Powhatan,</i>
that commanded him to be slain; how his Daughter <i>Pocahontas</i> saves his
life, returned him to <i>James</i> Town, relieved him and his famished Company,
which was but eight and thirty to possess those large Dominions; how he
discovered all the several Nations, upon the Rivers falling into the Bay
of <i>Chisapeacke;</i> flung near to death with a most Poisoned taile of a Fish
called Stingray: how <i>Powhatan</i> out of his Country took the Kings of
<i>Pamaunke</i> and <i>Paspahegh</i> Prisoners, forced thirty nine of those Kings to
pay him contribution, subjected all the Savages: how <i>Smith</i> was blown up
with Gun-powder, and returned for <i>England</i> to be cured.</p>

 <p class="quote">{MN} <i>Certain exploits of Captain</i> Smith.</p>


<p>Also how he brought our New <i>England</i> to the subjection of the Kingdom of
Great <i>Britain;</i> his fights with the Pirats, left alone amongst a many
<i>French</i> men of Warr, and his Ship ran from him; his Sea-fights for the
<i>French</i> against the <i>Spaniards;</i> their bad usage of him; how in <i>France</i>
in a little Boat he escaped them; was adrift all such a stormy Night at
Sea by himself, when thirteen <i>French</i> Ships were split, or driven on
shoar by the Isle of <i>Ree,</i> the General and most of his Men drowned, when
God, to whom be all Honour and Praise, brought him safe on shoar to all
their Admirations that escaped; you may read at large in his General
History of <i>Virginia,</i> the <i>Summer Isles,</i> and <i>New England.</i></p>

               the</i><br> Turks <i>and</i> Moors <i>to become men of Warr.</i></p>


<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps">As in all Lands</span> where there are many People, there are some Thieves, so in
all Seas much frequented, there are some Pirates; the most Ancient within
the Memory of threescore Years, was one <i>Callis,</i> who most refreshed
himself upon the Coast of <i>Wales; Clinton</i> and <i>Purser</i> his Companions,
who grew famous till Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> of Blessed Memory, hanged them at
<i>Wapping; Flemming</i> was as expert and as much sought for as they, yet such
a Friend to his Country, that discovering the <i>Spanish Armado,</i> he
voluntarily came to <i>Plimouth,</i> yielded himself freely to my Lord Admiral,
and gave him notice of the <i>Spaniards</i> coming; which good warning came so
happily and unexpectedly, that he had his Pardon, and a good Reward; some
few Pirates there then remained; notwithstanding it is incredible how many
great and rich Prizes the little Barques of the West Country daily brought
home, in regard of their small Charge; {MN} for there are so many
difficulties in a great Navy, by Wind and Weather, Victual, Sickness,
losing and finding one another, they seldom defray half the charge: But
for the Grace, State and Defence of the Coast and narrow Seas, a great
Navy is most necessary, but not to Attempt any far Voyage, except there be
such a Competent flock, they want not wherewith to furnish and supply all
things with expedition; but to the purpose.</p>

                              <hr width="80%">

 <p class="quote">{MN} <i>The difficulties of a great Navy.</i></p>


<p>{MN} After the death of our most Gracious Queen Elizabeth of Blessed
Memory, our Royal King <i>James,</i> who from his Infancy had Reigned in Peace
with all Nations; had no imployment for those Men of Warr, so that those
that were Rich relied with that they had; those that were poor and had
nothing but from hand to Mouth, turned Pirates; some, because they became
slighted of those for whom they had got much Wealth; some for that they
could not get their Due; some that had lived bravely, would not abase
themselves to Poverty; some vainly, only to get a name; others for
Revenge, Covetousness, or as ill; and as they found themselves more and
more oppressed, their Passions increasing with discontent, made them turn
Pirates.</p>

                              <hr width="80%">

 <p class="quote">{MN} <i>What occasioneth Pirates.</i></p>


<p>{MN} Now because they grew hatefull to all <i>Christian</i> Princes, they
retired to Barbary, where altho' there be not many good Harbours, but
<i>Tunis, Argier, Sally, Mamora,</i> and <i>Tituane,</i> there are many convenient
Rodes, or the open Sea, which is their chief Lordship: For their best
Harbours <i>Massalqueber,</i> the Towns of <i>Oran, Mellila, Tangier,</i> and
<i>Ceuta,</i> within the Streights, are possessed by the <i>Spaniards;</i> without
the Streights they have also <i>Arzella</i> and <i>Mazagan; Mamora</i> they have
likewise lately taken, and Fortified. <i>Ward</i> a poor <i>English</i> Sailer, and
<i>Dansker</i> a <i>Dutchman,</i> made first here their Marts; when the <i>Moors</i> knew
scarce how to sail a Ship; <i>Bishop</i> was Ancient and did little hurt; but
<i>Easton</i> got so much as made himself a Marquess in <i>Savoy;</i> and <i>Ward</i>
lived like a Bashay in <i>Barbary;</i> those were the first that taught the
<i>Moors</i> to be Men of War. <i>Gennings, Harris, Tompson,</i> and divers others
were taken in Ireland, a Coast they much frequented, and died at <i>Wapping.
Haws, Bough, Smith, Walsingham, Ellis, Collins, Sawkwel, Wollingstone,
Barrow, Wilson, Sayres,</i> and divers others, all these were Captains
amongst the Pirates, whom King <i>James</i> Mercifully Pardon'd; and was it not
strange, a few of those should command the Seas. Notwithstanding the
<i>Malteses,</i> the Pope, <i>Florentines, Genoeses, French, Dutch</i> and <i>Engish,</i>
Gallies and Men of War, they Would rob before their Faces, and even at
their own Ports, yet seldom more than three, four, five, or six in a
Fleet: many times they had very good Ships, and well Man'd, but commonly
in such Factions amongst themselves, and so Riotous, Quarrellous,
Treacherous, Blasphemous and Villainous, it is more than a wonder they
could so long continue, to do so much Mischief; and all they got, they
basely consumed it amongst <i>Jews, Turks, Moors,</i> and Whores.</p>

                              <hr width="80%">

 <p class="quote">{MN} <i>Their chief Rendezvous.</i></p>


<p>The best was, they would seldom go to Sea, so long as they could possibly
live on shoar, being compiled of <i>English, French, Dutch</i> and <i>Moors,</i>
(but very few <i>Spaniards</i> or <i>Italians</i>) commonly running one from
another, till they became so disjointed, disordered, debauched, and
miserable, {MN} that the <i>Turks</i> and <i>Moors</i> began to command them as
Slaves, and force them to instruct them in their best skill, which many an
accursed Runnagado, or <i>Christian</i> turned <i>Turk</i> did, till they have made
those Sally-men or <i>Moors</i> of <i>Barbary</i> so Powerful as they be, to the
Terror of all the Streights, and many times they take Purchase in the Main
Ocean, yea sometimes in the narrow Seas in <i>England,</i> and those are the
most cruel Villains in <i>Turky</i> or <i>Barbary;</i> whose Natives are very Noble,
and of good Natures, in comparison of them.</p>

 <p class="quote">{MN} <i>Renegados.</i></p>


<p>{MN} To conclude, The Misery of a Pirate, (altho' many are sufficient
Seamen as any) yet in regard of his superfluity, you shall find it such,
that any wise Man would rather live amongst wild Beasts, than them;
therefore let all unadvised Persons take heed they entertain that quality;
and I could how wish Merchants, Gentlemen, and all Setters forth of Ships,
not to be sparing of a Competent Pay, nor true Payment; for neither
Soldiers nor Seamen can live without Means, but necessity will force them
to steal; and when they are once entered into that Trade, they are hardly
reclaimed. Those Titles of Seamen and Soldiers, have been most worthily
honoured and esteemed, but now regarded for the most part, but as the
scum of the World; regain therefore your wonted Reputations and endeavour
rather to Adventure to those fair Plantations of our English Nation; which
however in the beginning were scorned contemned, yet now you see how many
Rich and Gallant People come from thence, who went thither as Poor as any
Soldier or Sailer, and gets more in one Year, than you by Piracy in seven.
I intreat you therefore to consider how many Thousands yearly go thither;
also how many Ships and Sailers are imployed to Transport them, and what
Custom they Yearly pay to our most Royal King Charles, whole Prosperity
and his Kingdom's good, I humbly beseech the Immortal God to preserve and
increase.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
